            "bodyText": "At least 50 people were killed by Myanmar soldiers in a raid on a village in Rakhine State last week, say local residents and opposition forces.  Warning: You may find some of the details in this piece disturbing Eyewitnesses told the BBC the village was subjected to two-and-half days of terror as soldiers blindfolded and beat them up, poured burning petrol on their skin and forced some of them to drink their urine.  They were looking for supporters of the Arakan Army (AA), which has become one of the most effective ethnic fighting forces in Myanmar. Fifty-one people aged between 15 and 70 were \"violently tortured and killed\", the National Unity Government (NUG), representing the ousted civilian government, said in a statement. The AA estimated the death toll to be more than 70 people.   The ruling military council, or junta, has denied the accusations, which would amount to one of the worst atrocities committed in the three year-old Myanmar civil war.  \u201cThey asked the men if the AA was in this village,\u201d one woman told the BBC. \u201cWhatever answer they gave, whether they said AA was there or it wasn\u2019t, or they didn\u2019t know, the soldiers hit them.\" In just six months, the AA has swept through most of Rakhine State, forcing the military to keep retreating. It ended a ceasefire with the army last year and joined ethnic insurgents in other parts of the country in a combined operation aimed at overthrowing the junta which seized power in February 2021. \"I saw with my own eyes my husband being taken away in a military vehicle. My son was separated from both of us, and I don't know where he is. Now I don't know if my son and husband are alive or dead,\" the woman told the BBC.  The names of witnesses are not being used to protect them. They told the BBC that everyone in the village, which has just over 1,000 households, were kept out  in the open for two days, under the sun, with little to eat or drink, while dozens of men were tied, blindfolded and some taken away in trucks for further interrogation. Many are yet to return.  \"They were so thirsty, standing all day in the sun, and begged for water. But the soldiers urinated in water bottles and gave them to the men,\" the woman told the BBC.  She said she heard \"lots of gunshots\", but didn't see who was shot \"because we had to keep our heads down\". \"I didn't dare to look. They called someone standing near me. Then I heard a gunshot. He never came back.'' She was crying throughout because she was worried about her husband and son: \"I didn't know if they were dead or alive. I was praying for them, \u2018Buddha, please save them\u2019.\" Survivors say they could hear soldiers asking for shovels to bury the bodies. They say some were clearly drunk.  More than 100 soldiers are believed to have raided the village Byai Phyu, which is just outside the state capital of Sittwe, on Wednesday.  Sittwe, a city with around 200,000 inhabitants, a large port and airport, is one of the Burmese army's few remaining strongholds. But the insurgents are close, and enjoy the sympathy of much of the ethnic Rakhine population.  Men who had tattoos showing support for the AA were singled out for especially harsh treatment, locals said. One eyewitness said the soldiers cut out the tattooed skin, poured petrol onto it and set it alight. Another eyewitness recalled an army officer telling the villagers he had come from the fighting in northern Shan State, where the military suffered heavy losses late last year, to take his revenge on them. Losing Rakhine State on the border with Bangladesh would be one of the greatest humiliations ever suffered by the armed forces, which have dominated Myanmar since independence in 1948. On Friday those left standing in the marketplace, mostly women, children and the elderly,  were ordered to gather a few things and leave. They said the soldiers had already looted anything valuable, like gold, jewellery or solar panels from their homes. The locals were initially taken to a stadium in Sittwe, but most have moved to seek shelter in Buddhist monasteries in the city.  The BBC understands that the army still controls Byai Phyu, and no-one is being allowed back. There are reports that much of the village has been burned down. The NUG has promised to bring those responsible for war crimes in Byai Phyu to justice. The AA also accused what it calls \"the fascist military council\" of \"vicious cruelty\", and of gang-raping some of the women in Byai Phyu. The junta has denied all allegations of torture, stating that they were only conducting \"peace and security\" measures in the village after spotting sandbag bunkers there. It accuses the Arakan Army of launching drone strikes from that area of Sittwe. The isolation of Rakhine State and the intensity of the conflict make any independent investigation of what happened in Byai Phyu impossible for the foreseeable future.  But the accounts given by survivors are an ominous warning of what could happen elsewhere in Myanmar as the military continues to lose ground to an increasingly confident and capable armed opposition movement.

            "bodyText": "An Israeli air strike on a UN school packed with displaced Palestinians in central Gaza has reportedly killed at least 35 people. Local journalists told the BBC that a warplane fired two missiles at classrooms on the top floor of the school in the urban Nuseirat refugee camp. Videos showed the destruction and a number of bodies. Israel\u2019s military said it had \u201cconducted a precise strike on a Hamas compound\u201d in the school and killed many of the 20 to 30 fighters it believed were inside. Gaza\u2019s Hamas-run Government Media Office denied the claim and accused Israel of carrying out a \u201chorrific massacre\u201d. The head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa), which runs the school, described the incident as \"horrific\" and said the claim that armed groups might have been inside a shelter was \"shocking\" but could not be confirmed. Dead and wounded people were rushed to the al-Aqsa Martyrs\u2019 Hospital, in the nearby town of Deir al-Balah, which has been overwhelmed since the Israeli military began a new ground operation against Hamas in central Gaza this week. The circumstances of the strike in Nuseirat are still unclear and the BBC is working to verify the information coming in. Local journalists and residents said it took place in the early hours of Thursday at al-Sardi school, which is in a south-eastern area of the densely-populated, decades-old camp, where Unrwa provides services. The school was full of hundreds of displaced people who had fled the fighting elsewhere in Gaza, according to the residents. Many schools and other UN facilities have been used as shelters by the 1.7 million people who have fled their homes during the war, which has lasted almost eight months. \u201cI was asleep when the incident occurred. Suddenly, we heard a loud explosion and shattered glass and debris from the building fell on us,\u201d Udai Abu Elias, a man who was living at the school, told BBC Arabic's Gaza Today programme. \u201cSmoke filled the air, and I couldn't see anything. I didn't expect to make it out alive. I heard someone calling for survivors to come out from under the rubble. I struggled to see as I stumbled over the bodies of the martyrs.\u201d He added: \u201cThe situation has become extremely difficult, especially for children and the elderly. Everyone is a target. The blood of the martyrs has not yet dried; it stains the stairs, walls, and bedding.\" Another man, Jabr, said he \u201cwoke up to the sight of bodies and [human] remains everywhere\u201d, while a third who asked not to be named said the casualties included \"elderly people, young individuals, and children\". Videos shared on social media showed the destruction of several classrooms at the school, as well as bodies wrapped in white shrouds and blankets. \"Enough war! We have been displaced dozens of times. They killed our children while they were sleeping,\" a woman injured in the attack screamed in one video. Residents initially said that more than 20 people were killed in the attack. Later, an official at al-Aqsa hospital told a freelance journalist working for the BBC that it had received 40 bodies from the school. Gaza\u2019s Hamas-run health ministry said in a statement that 40 people were killed, including 14 children and nine women, and 74 others were injured. The same death toll was given by the director of the Hamas-run Government Media Office, Ismail al-Thawabta. The head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa), Philippe Lazzarini, said in a statement on X, formerly Twitter, that at least 35 people were killed and many more injured. The agency\u2019s director of communications, Juliette Touma, told the BBC that \"the figures are coming from our own Unrwa colleagues on the ground\". In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said fighter jets had conducted a \"precise strike on a Hamas compound embedded inside an Unrwa school in the area of Nuseirat\". An annotated aerial photograph highlighted classrooms on two upper floors of the building, which the IDF said were the \u201clocations of the terrorists\u201d. The IDF said members of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad who took part in the 7 October attack on southern Israel, when around 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage, had been operating in the building. \u201cBefore the strike, a number of steps were taken to reduce the risk of harming uninvolved civilians during the strike, including conducting aerial surveillance, and additional intelligence information,\u201d it added. Later, IDF spokesman Lt Col Peter Lerner told reporters that between 20 and 30 fighters had been using the school to plan and carry out attacks, and that many of them were killed in the strike. \"I'm not aware of any civilian casualties and I'd be very, very cautious of accepting anything that Hamas puts out,\" he added. He also said the IDF had called off the attack twice in order to limit civilian casualties and accused Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad of deliberately using UN facilities as operational bases. Mr Thawabta rejected the IDF\u2019s claims, saying: \u201cThe occupation uses lying to the public opinion through false fabricated stories to justify the brutal crime it conducted against dozens of displaced people.\u201d Philippe Lazzarini said the school was hit \u201cwithout prior warning\u201d to his agency or the 6,000 displaced people who were sheltering there. \u201cClaims that armed groups may have been inside the shelter are shocking. We are however unable to verify these claims,\u201d he added. \u201cAttacking, targeting or using UN buildings for military purposes are a blatant disregard of International Humanitarian law. UN staff, premises and operations must be protected at all times.\u201d Mr Lazzarini complained that more than 180 Unrwa buildings had been hit since the war began despite their co-ordinates being shared with parties to the conflict, and that more than 450 displaced people had been killed as a result. \u201cThis must stop and all those responsible must be held accountable,\u201d he said. At least 36,650 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched a military campaign in response to the 7 October attack, according to the territory's health ministry, whose figures do not differentiate between civilians and combatants. On Wednesday, the Israeli military said it had taken \u201coperational control\u201d over eastern areas of Bureij refugee camp \u2013 which is just west of Nuseirat - and eastern Deir al-Balah. Residents reported intense bombardment and the charity M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) said at least 70 bodies - the majority women and children - had been brought to al-Aqsa hospital over the previous 24 hours. Last month, there was global outrage after an Israeli air strike, which the IDF said targeted two senior Hamas officials, and a resulting fire reportedly killed dozens of Palestinians at a tented camp for displaced people near a Unrwa logistics base in the southern city of Rafah.  The IDF said the loss of life was \u201ctragic\u201d and that it was investigating the possibility that ammunition stored by Hamas could have exploded. That incident prompted mediators to revive their efforts to broker a ceasefire and hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas. US President Joe Biden outlined last Friday what he described as an Israeli proposal that had been presented to Hamas. The first phase of the plan would last six weeks and include a temporary truce that would see the release of some of the hostages still being held in Gaza in return for Palestinians from Israeli jails. The second phase would include a permanent cessation of hostilities. On Thursday, the US, UK and 16 other countries with citizens among the hostages issued a joint statement calling on the leaders of Israel and Hamas \u201cto make whatever final compromises are necessary to close this deal and bring relief to the families of our hostages\u201d. Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh said on Wednesday that the group would deal \"seriously and positively\" with a proposal based on an end to the war and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted he will not agree to a permanent ceasefire before Hamas is defeated and the hostages are released. On Wednesday, he declared that the country was \u201cstriving for total victory\u201d. Additional reporting by George Wright in London One of the opponents to the mural says she is \u201cextremely concerned\u201d by the artwork. Medical charity MSF says 70 dead people have been brought to a central Gaza hospital since Tuesday. Councillors say approving the application would \u201cimpact on community cohesion\u201d. Residents of areas on the Israel-Lebanon border tell the BBC they \"feel like the forgotten people\". The plan to punish ICC officials for seeking to arrest Israeli officials could split Joe Biden's Democrats. Copyright 2024 BBC.

            "bodyText": "At least 150 people are feared dead in a massacre in a village in central Sudan blamed on the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), the paramilitary group fighting the army. The rivals have been battling over control of the country for more than 13 months. The RSF has not commented on the accusations, but on Thursday boasted of attacking two army positions. Footage circulating on social media after Wednesday's raid showed dozens of bodies wrapped in white shrouds prepared for burial in Wad al-Nourah in Gezira state. That video was filmed by activists from a neighbourhood resistance committee,  part of a network of local groups across the country which back a return to civilian rule. The Madani Resistance Committee said it was now \"waiting for a confirmed toll of the dead and injured\". The circumstances of the killings remain unclear - it is alleged the village was attacked twice by the RSF fighters on Wednesday. Hafiz Mohamad, from leading human rights group Justice Africa Sudan, has told the BBC that many more people are still missing but that it was \"difficult to count all the dead\" because \"RSF elements are still around the area looting\". Sudan\u2019s military government has called for international condemnation of the Wad al-Nourah attack. The RSF took control of Gezira state, to the south of the capital, Khartoum, in December and has been accused of carrying out numerous abuses against civilians there - which it denies. Meanwhile, intense battles continue between the RSF and military in El Fasher, a city in Darfur in the west of the country. Across the country, more than 15,000 people are estimated to have been killed since the conflict started in April 2023. Several rounds of peace talks have failed to end the war, which began when the two generals leading the army and RSF fell out. UN agencies say the fighting has sparked the world\u2019s largest displacement crisis and that millions are facing a hunger catastrophe as a result. Martin Griffiths, the UN\u2019s under-secretary general for humanitarian affairs, said this week that up to five million people were highly likely to be at risk of famine. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever had this kind of number at risk of famine,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cthis was an avoidable conflict.\u201d \u201cIt is a place where two men decided that they were going to resolve their differences through fighting and take their country down,\u201d said Mr Griffiths.

            "bodyText": "A World War Two US Navy veteran travelling to France for an event marking the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings has died, a veteran organisation has confirmed. Robert \"Al\" Persichitti from Rochester, New York, was airlifted to a hospital in Germany on 30 May after suffering a medical emergency aboard a ship heading to Europe.  He died the following day, aged 102. Remembered as a \"great, humble man,\" Mr Persichitti was involved in the allied operation in Japan.  Honor Flight - a veteran organisation Mr Persichitti belonged to - confirmed his death on social media and said he had \"served his country bravely without hesitation\". The non-profit helps transport former US servicemen to the memorials of the respective wars they fought in. The 102-year-old was selected to attend the event in Normandy by the National World War Two Museum in New Orleans, which paid for and organised the trip, a local affiliate of CBS News, the BBC's US partner, reported. \"I'm really excited to be going\", he told broadcaster WROC-TV a day before he set off. His cardiologist had encouraged him to travel, he added. Al DeCarlo, who served alongside Mr Persichitti in Japan, was also on the trip. He told local media in Rochester that his friend did not die alone. \"The doctor was with him... he was at peace and he was comfortable,\" he said, according to ABC news agency affiliate, WHAM-TV.  \"She put his favourite singer, Frank Sinatra, on her phone and he peacefully left us.\" The pair served in Iwo Jima together, a Japanese island the US captured from the country's imperial army in 1945. Mr Persichitti's friend of 46 years, Pastor William Leone, told WHAM-TV \"he had a real zest for living\" and would visit children in local schools to talk to about his experiences. The veteran was also a former teacher. In April, students at a local school helped organise a birthday celebration in his honour. In 2020, he was named an honouree of New York State Senate's Veteran Hall of Fame by the then Senator Rich Funke.  His local chapter of Honor Flight in Rochester said they will miss him.

            "bodyText": "A controversy over a waterfall has cascaded into a social media storm in China, even prompting an explanation from the water body itself.  A hiker posted a video that showed the flow of water from Yuntai Mountain Waterfall - billed as China's tallest uninterrupted waterfall - was coming from a pipe built high into the rock face. The clip has been liked more than 70,000 times since it was first posted on Monday.  Operators of the Yuntai tourism park said that they made the \"small enhancement\" during the dry season so visitors would feel that their trip had been worthwhile. \"The one about how I went through all the hardship to the source of Yuntai Waterfall only to see a pipe,\" the caption of the video posted by user \"Farisvov\" reads. The topic \"the origin of Yuntai Waterfall is just some pipes\" began trending all over social media.  It received more than 14 million views on Weibo and nearly 10 million views on Douyin - causing such an uproar that local government officials were sent to the park to investigate.  They asked the operators to learn a lesson from the incident and explain the enhancements to tourists ahead of time, according to state broadcaster CCTV.    The park later posted on behalf of the waterfall saying, \"I didn't expect to meet everyone this way\". \"As a seasonal scenery I can't guarantee that I will be in my most beautiful form everytime you come to see me,\" it adds.  \"I made a small enhancement during the dry season only so I would look my best to meet my friends.\" Located in central Henan province, the 312-metre Yuntai falls is located inside the Yuntai Mountain Geopark, a UNESCO Global Geopark. Millions of visitors travel there every year, drawn by geological formations that date back more than a billion years. Park officials told CCTV that the water they used to pump water into the falls was spring water, adding that it would not damage the natural landscape. Many social media users appeared to be understanding of the situation. \"Yuntai park: Does this person not have better things to do?\" a comment liked nearly 40,000 times on Douyin reads. \"I think it's a good thing to do. Otherwise people would be disappointed if they end up seeing nothing there,\" a user on Weibo said. But there is also criticism. \"It's not respecting the natural order, and not respecting the tourists,\" a Weibo user wrote. \"How could it be called the No.1 waterfall anymore,\" another user commented on Douyin. This is not the first time artificial measures have been used to \"help\" famous waterfalls in China.  Huangguoshu Waterfall, a famous tourist destination in the southwestern Guizhou province, has been helped by a water diversion project from a nearby dam since 2006 to maintain its  flow during the dry season. Narendra Modi has won - but the election is being seen as a huge comeback for his opponents. The \"sophisticated internet fraud syndicate\" targeted people around the world, Zambian authorities say. Mr Modi has lost some of his aura of invincibility and the results mean the opposition is back.  Beijing says the UK's MI6 took advantage of Mr Wang's \"strong desire for money\". Supplies of electricity have been cut off in several areas and schools ordered to remain shut. Copyright 2024 BBC.

            "bodyText": "Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned that Moscow could arm countries with a view to attacking Western targets. Mr Putin made the statement while criticising the West's delivery of long-range weapons to Ukraine. Several countries including the United States have given Ukraine the green light to strike targets inside Russia. Such action could lead to \u201cvery serious problems\", Mr Putin told foreign reporters. \"If someone thinks it is possible to supply such weapons to a war zone to attack our territory and create problems for us, why don't we have the right to supply weapons of the same class to regions of the world where there will be strikes on sensitive facilities of those countries?\" the Russian president said. \"That is, the response can be asymmetric. We will think about it.\" He did not specify which countries Moscow could supply weapons to. Mr Putin singled out Germany, which recently told Ukraine it was free to hit targets inside Russia with long-range German-made weapons. \"When they say that there will be more missiles which will hit targets on Russian territory, this definitively destroys Russian-German relations,\" Mr Putin said. US President Joe Biden has given Ukraine permission to use American-supplied weapons to strike targets in Russia, but only near the Kharkiv region. The White House has said Ukraine cannot use long-range ATACMS missiles on Russian soil. Ukraine has used US weapons to strike inside Russia in recent days, a US senator and a Western official told the Associated Press on Wednesday. Fierce fighting has been raging north-east of Kharkiv since a new Russian push across Ukraine's northern border. Kharkiv, Ukraine's second city, is just 30km (18 miles) from the border. UK Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron has said it is up to Ukraine to decide how to use British weapons and insisted it has the right to strike targets on Russian territory. Ukraine says North Korean missiles are being used inside Ukrainian territory, and Western intelligence agencies say Russia has been using Iranian-made drones in the conflict. Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Mr Putin was speaking to foreign journalists at the annual St Petersburg International Economic Forum. He also warned that the West was wrong to assume that Moscow would never use nuclear weapons. \"For some reason, the West believes that Russia will never use it,\" Mr Putin said when asked by Reuters about the risk of nuclear escalation over Ukraine. \"We have a nuclear doctrine, look what it says. If someone's actions threaten our sovereignty and territorial integrity, we consider it possible for us to use all means at our disposal. \"This should not be taken lightly, superficially.\" Mr Putin also dismissed the idea that Russia has plans to attack Nato territory. \"You should not make Russia out to be the enemy. You're only hurting yourself with this, you know?\" Mr Putin said. \"They thought that Russia wanted to attack Nato. Have you gone completely crazy? That is as thick as this table. Who came up with this? It is just complete nonsense, you know? Total rubbish.\" Donald Tusk is urging Poles to vote for his coalition, to best protect against Russian aggression. Craig Lang is facing charges in the double homicide and armed robbery of a Florida couple. Deep in Putin's Russia, Ivanovo's George Orwell library is still lending books on totalitarianism. Wales will be without Laura O\u2019Sullivan and Josie Green for Tuesday's 2025 Women's European Championship qualifier away to Ukraine. Both countries are trying to dissuade others from attending the upcoming event, Ukraine's president says. Copyright 2024 BBC.

            "bodyText": "The results of India\u2019s general election announced on Tuesday are being interpreted in a rather unusual way. While the winners appear subdued, the runners-up are celebrating. The NDA alliance, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has won a historic third term in power, with more than 290 seats in the 543-member parliament.  But his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on its own did not reach the magic figure of 272 seats needed to form the government \u2013 and the prime minister is now being seen as a much diminished leader. The outcome is being seen as a huge comeback for the opposition INDIA alliance and Congress party leader Rahul Gandhi, the face of the bloc.  The alliance has won just over 230 seats and doesn\u2019t have the numbers to cobble together a government \u2013 but more than 24 hours after counting of votes began, they were yet to concede. \u201cIt\u2019s an extraordinary story,\u201d political analyst Rashid Kidwai told the BBC. \u201cThe result is surprising. The opposition has managed to pull off the unexpected.\u201d A jubilant Congress party called the verdict \u201ca moral and political defeat for Mr Modi\", whose BJP had campaigned predominantly on his name and record. On Tuesday evening, Mr Gandhi told a press conference that \u201cthe country has unanimously sent a message to Mr Modi and [Home Minister] Amit Shah that we do not want you\u201d. There\u2019s a backdrop to this exuberance. Going into the election, the opposition seemed in complete disarray and the Congress-led INDIA bloc, made up of more than two dozen disparate regional parties, appeared to be on the verge of imploding. Experts questioned whether it was fit to challenge Mr Modi, who looked unstoppable at the time. And as the election neared, the opposition faced an uphill battle. Parties and leaders were raided by government agencies; two chief ministers \u2013 including Arvind Kejriwal of Delhi \u2013 were jailed; and bank accounts belonging to Congress were frozen by the income-tax authorities. The credit for the opposition\u2019s performance, Mr Kidwai says, largely goes to Mr Gandhi, the much criticised scion of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty. His great-grandfather Jawaharlal Nehru was the first and longest-serving prime minister of India. His grandmother and father also served as PM. \u201cHe\u2019s a fifth generation dynast and came with a lot of historical baggage,\u201d the political analyst explains. \u201cThe mainstream media in India was very hostile to him and social media didn\u2019t take him seriously. He was targeted and projected as a non-serious politician who took too many holidays.\u201d But, Mr Kidwai says, he overcame the odds and, in recent years, has worked hard to change that impression of himself and his party. \u201cDuring his Bharat Jodo Yatra and the Nyay March through the length and breadth of the country, he met millions of people \u2013 which added to his stature and won him lots of support. It also gave him confidence and political heft.\u201d But Mr Gandhi was still not perceived as a threat to Mr Modi. Last year, a court in Mr Modi\u2019s home state Gujarat convicted the Congress leader of defamation. He was thrown out of parliament and barred from contesting elections \u2013 until the Supreme Court suspended his conviction.  The perception that the BJP was seeking to go after the opposition, says political analyst and author Ajoy Bose, backfired. \u201cThe BJP got a bit arrogant and complacent. But their shock and awe tactics to intimidate the opposition worked against the BJP and led to the formation of the INDIA bloc.\u201d The parties, he says, \u201cwere afraid they would be wiped off and many saw echoes of Emergency [a reference to the 1975 action of then-PM Indira Gandhi to suspend elections and curb civil rights] in the way the government was functioning\u201d. India has \u201ca history of competitive democracy\u201d, Mr Bose says, adding that among the people \u201cthere was a sense of disquiet and discomfort about the country turning into a one-party dictatorship\u201d. As the results show, the BJP juggernaut met strong resistance in several opposition-ruled states. In Tamil Nadu, the ruling DMK party kept the BJP out by winning all 39 seats in the state. In West Bengal, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee fought to limit the BJP to 12 seats (Mr Modi\u2019s party had won 18 of the 42 seats in 2019). In Maharashtra, the BJP was limited to nine seats \u2013 it had won 23 of the 48 seats in 2019 and its then-ally Shiv Sena had bagged a further 18. But the biggest upset for Mr Modi and the BJP, Mr Bose says, came from the bellwether state of Uttar Pradesh (UP). \u201cAkhilesh Yadav and his Samajwadi Party (SP) is the biggest success story of this election. A very clever alliance with Rahul Gandhi won them 43 of the state\u2019s 80 seats. The BJP\u2019s tally has been restricted to a poor 33.\u201d Mr Modi's party won 62 seats in 2019 and took 71 in 2014. In the run-up to the election, Mr Modi had described Rahul Gandhi and Akhilesh Yadav as \u201ca pair of boys\u201d whose alliance had \u201cflopped\u201d many times in the past. But as the results show, this pair of boys soundly beat the BJP in UP. \u201cA key takeaway from the election,\u201d Mr Bose says, \u201cis that the grand new Ram temple in Ayodhya city wasn\u2019t enough for the BJP to win.\u201d The party had banked on the Ram Mandir temple to be their trump card, with Mr Modi presiding over the opening of the unfinished temple in Ayodhya with much fanfare in January. But in the Faizabad constituency, where it is located, the BJP candidate lost. Abhishek Yadav, an SP youth-wing leader and a star campaigner for his party, told the BBC that initially they too believed that the temple would help the BJP win the key state. \u201cUntil early April, [the] election in the state had seemed like a one-sided contest with the odds stacked against us,\u201d Mr Yadav told me recently. \u201cBut we sensed there was an undercurrent of resentment against the BJP when large numbers of people started gathering at our rallies.\u201d People were unhappy about a lack of jobs and high food and fuel prices, he said. Many were also angry with the changes in how army soldiers are recruited. \u201cWith the Congress and SP fighting the election together as part of INDIA alliance, all anti-BJP voters came together to vote for us,\u201d he added. Mr Kidwai says that \u2013 notwithstanding the surprisingly good performance of the opposition \u2013 in some ways, it was a missed opportunity, as the INDIA bloc failed to read the voters\u2019 minds and did not sense the disquiet they felt with Mr Modi\u2019s government. \u201cThey spoke about joblessness, rural economic distress and were able to win over many voters \u2013 but there were lots of gaps in their strategy,\u201d he says. \u201cThe NDA\u2019s third term has come only because of weaknesses in the INDIA bloc. They could have forged alliances in Andhra Pradesh and Odisha and that would have made their tally stronger.\u201d But now that the NDA \u2013 and Mr Modi \u2013 are back in power, INDIA needs to institutionalise its alliance and Mr Gandhi, \u201cthe chief architect of the alliance\u201d, must lead from the front, Mr Kidwai adds. \u201cIt\u2019s unlikely that the government will stop going after the opposition. But it also can\u2019t be business as usual for the government. They cannot continue with their politics of vendetta; it will have to be toned down. \u201cThe strength of opposition in parliament would allow restoration of functional ties in parliament. There\u2019s great need for coalition politics now. And Congress as the single largest opposition party in the coalition must lead from the front. \u201cThe Gandhis consider themselves as trustees of power, not power-wielders. But now the time has come to change. Rahul Gandhi has to take on the mantle of leadership and lead.\u201d The International Cricket Council has no plans to move T20 World Cup matches out of New York despite concerns over poor pitches. A hiker posted a  video showing the water flow of the fall was coming from a pipe built into the rock face.

            "bodyText": "Nvidia's market value has surged past $3tn (\u00a32.3tn), lifting the chip giant ahead of Apple to become the second most valuable publicly listed company in the world. The firm's share price rose more than 5% on Wednesday, to more than $1,224.  It extended a breathtakingly rapid climb that started last year, powered by bets that the US firm is positioned to be a major winner from a wave of investment in artificial intelligence (AI). Its market value now sits just behind Microsoft, another key player in the industry thanks to its investments in Chat GPT-maker OpenAI. Valued at \"just\" $2tn as recently as February, Nvidia sparked a new wave of share purchases after it announced plans last month for a so-called stock split. The move will increase the number of shares by a factor of 10 and reduce their value accordingly, a change aimed at making shares more affordable to small-time investors. Set to happen on Friday, it is expected to generate even more demand for the stock.  Founded in 1993, Nvidia was originally known for making the type of computer chips that process graphics, particularly for computer games. Long before the AI revolution, it started adding features to its chips that it says help machine learning - all of which has helped it increase its market share. It is now seen as a key company to watch to see how fast AI-powered tech is spreading across the business world, a shift boss Jensen Huang has declared the dawn of the \"next industrial revolution\". His company has seen explosive growth, reporting sales of $26bn in the three months to 28 April - more than triple the same period in 2023, and up 18% from the previous three month. Optimism about AI is one of the forces behind a broader market rally over the last year, which pushed the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq in the United States to new records on Wednesday.  Apple had appeared to be losing out earlier this year as sales growth stalled. But in recent weeks, its shares have been buoyed by anticipation over how it plans to incorporate AI into its own strategy. Shares in the firm rose 0.7%, giving it a market capitalisation of roughly $3tn, which is generally calculated by multiplying the number of shares in a company by its current share price.

            "bodyText": "Novak Djokovic was the defending men's champion at the French Open Novak Djokovic says he will do his best to return to the court \"as soon as possible\" after undergoing surgery on a knee injury. The 24-time Grand Slam champion withdrew from Wednesday's French Open quarter-final against Casper Ruud after tearing the medial meniscus in his right knee during a fourth-round victory over Francisco Cerundolo. Recovery is likely to take at least three weeks, meaning the Serb could potentially miss Wimbledon, which starts on 1 July. The injury will also impact the 37-year-old's preparations for the Olympic Games, which begin on 27 July in Paris. \"I\u2019m still processing it all but I am happy to update you that the surgery went well,\" Djokovic wrote on X., external \"My love for this sport is strong and the desire to compete at the highest level is what keeps me going.\" Djokovic is a seven-time Wimbledon champion and lost to Carlos Alcaraz in a five-set thriller in last year's final. He has, however, never won Olympic gold, and has made no secret that adding that title was a key priority for him this year. \"I am so appreciative of the team of doctors who have been by my side as well as the overwhelming support I have received from my fans,\" Djokovic wrote alongside a picture of himself and his medical team. \"I\u2019m going to do my best to be healthy and fit to return to the court as soon as possible.\" Djokovic will also lose his status as the world number one with Italy's Jannik Sinner set to take his place.

The eruption sent a plume of ash kilometres into the sky, and caused dozens of flights to be cancelled and hundreds of people to be evacuated.  Authorities said further eruptions were possible.  Cold lava is a mixture of volcanic material and pebbles which flows down the slope of a volcano in the rain.  The phrase 'cold lava' is a translation of the term \"lahar\" in Indonesian and Tagalog.

            "bodyText": "The American Boeing company has launched its Starliner capsule towards the International Space Station (ISS) with two Nasa astronauts aboard. It's the first time the vehicle has been entrusted to carry people after coming through a long and tortuous development programme. Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams will be testing the capsule on a mission that's expected to last just over a week. Starliner is scheduled to dock with the space station on Thursday. The capsule went up from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida, riding a United Launch Alliance Atlas rocket. The 12-minute powered ascent looked flawless. Moments before lift-off, Commander Wilmore called out to thank all those who had worked to make the mission possible. Alluding to past difficulties, he said: \"When the going gets tough - and it often does - the tough get going, and you have.\" Starliner's pilot Suni Williams chimed in: \"Go 'Calypso'! (the name of the capsule). Take us to space and back.\"  Starliner now has to raise itself to the orbit of the ISS, which circles the Earth at an altitude of roughly 400km (250 miles). In the 24 hours this will take, Wilmore and Williams plan to put the vehicle through its paces, including taking manual control of the flight systems. This mission is a critical venture for manufacturer Boeing, which has been under pressure after a series of safety incidents on its aeroplanes. Starliner, likewise, has encountered numerous technical issues that have delayed its planned crewed debut by almost a decade. The most dramatic of these problems occurred on the capsule's first uncrewed test flight in 2019 when software errors forced the vehicle to abort its trip to the ISS. Nasa requested a second dummy run be conducted in 2022 to be sure the errors had been corrected. Recent days have once again focussed on Starliner's readiness with the discovery of a small helium leak in the spacecraft's propulsion system. Detailed analysis eventually led Boeing and Nasa to conclude the leak was not serious enough to hold up the launch. Starliner was developed in response to Nasa's request for commercial options to get its astronauts into space. Following the retirement of the famous shuttles in 2011, the agency wanted to move away from owning and operating vehicles to an arrangement where it could simply purchase the service - just like a company might outsource its IT needs or payroll. The new approach was designed to save Nasa money it could then spend on ambitious plans to return people to the Moon. The agency gave contracts to Boeing and SpaceX to help bring their capsules into service and then pay them for six operational missions. But whereas SpaceX was able to fly its crew flight test in 2020 and then complete six operational missions by March this year, Boeing is still at the stage of the initial crew flight test. If Starliner can prove itself over the coming days, it will join SpaceX's Dragon capsule in the routine transport of astronauts, potentially as early as the beginning of next year. \"Right now, we have one provider giving us that access to the space station,\" top Nasa official Jim Free explained. \"This will give us a second provider, which means if we have a problem with either, we have ways to get our crews to and from station, which helps keep the tempo that we've had for 23 years of having humans in low Earth orbit,\" the associate administrator said. For Mark Nappi, the Boeing vice president who leads the company's commercial crew programme, it was a relief to finally see the mission get away. \"My boss was here today. My boss's boss was here today and my boss's boss's boss is here today. So obviously, it means a tonne to us,\" he told reporters. Starliner is heading up to the space station with about 340kg (760lbs) of cargo. A key supply item is a replacement pump for the system on the ISS that purifies urine back to drinking water. Much of the cargo, however, is simply Boeing merchandise that will become memorabilia for this important test flight. This includes mission patches, coins, silver Snoopy pens, American flags and a hard drive with about 3,500 pieces of artwork from children across the world. If all goes to plan, Wilmore and Williams will return to Earth late next week. The Starliner is designed to come back to land, using airbags to soften contact with the ground. There are a number of places in the US southwest where the touchdown could be performed, but mission managers will wait to see local weather forecasts before making a final choice. The earliest opportunity would be 14 June at the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico.  \"There's nothing magic about that date. A few days later, we have another set of opportunities as well,\" said Steve Stitch, Nasa's commercial crew programme manager. The Royal Society of Chemistry says the current regulation of chemicals is 'not fit for purpose'. Who are the seven surviving members of humanity's greatest feat of exploration? The species poses a deadly threat to honey bees, master beekeeper Lynne Ingram tells the BBC. Advancements mean thousands of supernovae models can be developed in under a second, say researchers.

The man was badly burned after an explosion on Tuesday in a hotel room in Roissy-en-France, near Paris's Charles de Gaulle airport.  Investigators found evidence of equipment and materials intended to be used for bomb-making in his room, the National Anti-Terrorism Prosecutor's Office said. Guns and false passports were also found, according to French media reports. Anti-terror prosecutors have opened an investigation.  They are working with France's domestic spy agency, a source told the Reuters news agency. The suspect is currently being interviewed in hospital, after being treated for severe burns and then arrested. He is reportedly a Russian-speaker from the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine, much of which is currently occupied by Russia.   Christian Lamb was given the Legion d'honneur at a commemoration event in Ver-sur-Mer, Normandy. Organisers say the Paris Games will be protected by an \"unprecedented security operation\". Kieran Tonge will be joining hundreds of other WW2 vehicles taking the trip to Normandy. This year marks the 80th anniversary of the Battle of Normandy, which led to the end of World War two.

            "bodyText": "Three weeks after Robert Fico was gunned down in central Slovakia, he\u2019s made a full-throated return to political life - on the eve of the European elections. In a Facebook video apparently recorded at home in Bratislava, the Slovak prime minister laid the blame for the attack on Slovakia\u2019s liberal opposition, the \"anti-government media\" and foreign-funded NGOs for creating a climate of hatred and intolerance that made the shooting possible. Mr Fico, who was critically injured on 15 May after being shot multiple times in the abdomen, said he forgave his attacker - identified by prosecutors as 71-year-old Juraj C \u2013 and bore no hatred towards him. However, he said his assailant was an \u201cactivist of the Slovak opposition\u201d. The man, who faces a lengthy prison sentence for attempted murder, was a \u201cmessenger of the evil and political hatred\u201d whipped up by Slovakia\u2019s \u201cunsuccessful and frustrated\u201d opposition, Mr Fico said. Opposition parties - in particular the liberal Progressive Slovakia, which is neck-and-neck with Mr Fico\u2019s left-populist Smer party ahead of the European Parliament elections  - have condemned the shooting and have categorically rejected all links with the attacker. Mr Fico, who has served as prime minister for more than 10 of the last 18 years, returned to power last October at the head of a populist-nationalist coalition. Slovakia has become increasingly polarised in recent months and the attack has only deepened tensions.  In a video evidently recorded in the corridor of a police station hours after the attack in the central town of Handlova, the suspect \u2013 described as a poet and author - said he had been motivated by opposition to Mr Fico\u2019s policies, including the abolition of public broadcaster RTVS. Footage also emerged showing him at several anti-government demonstrations. However, older videos showed the man addressing a meeting of a far-right Slovak paramilitary organisation, so there is lingering confusion over his political beliefs. Mr Fico, appearing well and dressed in a crisp white and blue patterned shirt, said if all went well he would be able to return to work at the end of June. He appealed to the \"anti-government media\" - especially those outlets he said were co-owned by companies linked to US philanthropist George Soros as well as foreign-funded NGOs and the opposition - not to downplay the reasons for the assassination attempt. He had warned for months, he said, that the likelihood of an attack on a government official was \u201capproaching certainty\". The attack had taken place, he said, in an atmosphere where the opposition was exploiting the fact that the collective West was trying to force through a \u201csingle acceptable foreign policy\u201d, notably on Ukraine, and riding roughshod over smaller nations that were trying to embark on a sovereign path of their own. Mr Fico opposes military aid to Kyiv and says Vladimir Putin has been \"wrongly demonised\" by the West. The opposition\u2019s \u201cviolent or hateful excesses\u201d against a democratically-elected government had been met with silence by international organisations, he said, simply because opposition views were in line with Western policy on Ukraine. This was the atmosphere in which the assassination attempt had taken place, he said. \u201cI should be full of anger, hatred and revenge,\u201d Mr Fico said. \u201c[But] I would like to express my belief that all the pain I have gone through and am still going through will serve something good.\" Copyright 2024 BBC.

            "bodyText": "The UN's nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), has passed a resolution calling on Iran to urgently cooperate and reverse its decision to bar some of its inspectors. There are concerns Iran is trying to develop a nuclear weapon, an accusation Tehran denies.  The resolution, drafted by Britain, France and Germany, passed by the 35-nation board of governors was voted for by 20 countries, with only China and Russia voting it down. Twelve nations abstained and one country did not take part.  Iran called the decision \"hasty and unwise\", Iranian state TV reported.  The resolution, passed at a quarterly meeting in Vienna, said Iran must urgently, fully and unambiguously co-operate with the  IAEA. It also said Tehran should answer longstanding questions about uranium traces found at two sites there and allow some of the agency's most experienced enrichment inspectors back in to the country.  Iran is now enriching uranium up to 60% purity - close to the 90% needed for weapons grade - while it keeps accumulating large uranium stockpiles, according to the IAEA. The motion aims to raise diplomatic pressure on Iran. In a separate joint statement, France, Germany and the UK urged Iran to \"halt its nuclear escalation\" and refrain from making threats to produce nuclear weapons.  \"Much of Iran's nuclear programme is unprecedented for a state without a nuclear weapons programme,\" it said.  \"The production of uranium metal is a key step for the development of a nuclear weapon. We urge Iran not to undertake this work again.\" The United States, which backed the resolution, expressed concerns that Iran might respond with nuclear escalation.  In the past, similar resolutions and sanctions have prompted Tehran to retaliate by removing surveillance cameras and increasing its uranium enrichment.  Iran's state TV reported on Wednesday their nation's mission to the UN said: \"The decision of the Western countries was hasty and unwise, and it will undoubtedly have a detrimental impact on the process of diplomatic engagement and constructive cooperation (between Iran and the opposing parties).\"  Russia accuses Nato and the US of \"provoking a new level of tension\" over the use of Western-supplied weapons. Chinese firm MineOne Partners has been ordered to sell land it owns near a US nuclear missile site. The US has previously warned that Russia is trying to develop a space-based, anti-satellite weapon. The Labour leader also says he would match the Tory aim of raising defence spending to 2.5% of GDP. The film shines a light on the work done by scientists in New Mexico but locals say their story is untold. Copyright 2024 BBC.

Manuel Guerrero Avi\u00f1a, 44, was found guilty of being in possession of an illegal substance at a hearing in Doha and fined \u00a32,100. His family say police planted drugs in his apartment and Mr Guerrero Avi\u00f1a believes he was targeted by the sting because he is gay. Human rights group FairSquare called his trial a \u201ctravesty of justice\u201d but Qatari officials insist the airline worker's arrest in February was solely due to drug offences. Mr Guerrero Avi\u00f1a has called the verdict - which he is considering appealing - a human rights breach and says he was targeted because of his sexuality.  He said: \"Although I welcome the fact that I can leave the country, I still condemn the unfair trial I have been subjected to and the torture and ill treatment I endured during my preliminary detention\". Mr Guerrero Avi\u00f1a, an airline worker, said he is \"taking advice\" on his options. Qatari prosecutors have up to 30 days to appeal the sentence, meaning he can't leave the country immediately, even if he were to accept the verdict. James Lynch, co-director of human rights organisation FairSquare and former British diplomat in Qatar said the case was a \"travesty of justice.\" Homosexuality is illegal in Qatar, but the family of Mr Guerrero Avi\u00f1a say he had lived a normal life there for the past seven years and had never been in trouble with the authorities before. The case hit the headlines internationally when his family claimed he was targeted on gay dating app Grindr, after arranging to meet a man called \"Gio\". But he was instead met by police and arrested on drug charges, in what his family called a \"honeytrap operation\". After 42 days in a detention centre, Mr Guerrero Avi\u00f1a was released on the condition he handed over his passport. He was forced to thumbprint a confession written in Arabic, without the help of a translator or access to a lawyer's advice, his family say. Qatari officials insist the 44-year-old's arrest was \"for possession of illegal substances on his person and in his apartment\" and that \"no other factors were taken into account\". They added that tests for illegal substances in his system had come back positive for amphetamine and methamphetamine.  Amnesty International described the tests as \"questionable\" and not up to international standards. Mr Guerrero Avi\u00f1a denies taking any drugs.  Aya Majzoub, Amnesty International's Deputy Regional Director for the Middle East and Africa, said in a statement that authorities in the country must overturn Mr Guerrero Avi\u00f1a\u2019s \"outrageous conviction and lift his travel ban\". \"There are serious fears that [he] was targeted for his sexual orientation and was coerced into providing the authorities with information that they could use to pursue a wider crackdown on LGBTI individuals in Qatar\u201d. HIV charities had also launched interventions in the case after claims Mr Guerrero Avi\u00f1a, who is HIV positive, had not had regular access to his medication, which keeps the virus under control. Mr Guerrero Avi\u00f1a's family have told the BBC that his usual treatment, prescribed by British doctors, ran out in mid-April. The UK's National Aids Trust told the BBC he urgently needs to return to the UK for the medication as it is not available in Qatar, and he may have built up resistance to it, which would make it less effective. Deborah Gold, CEO of National Aids Trust, said: \"We are hugely concerned that he will not be able to access the ongoing medical care and treatment that is his human right while in Qatar.\" Mr Guerrero Avi\u00f1a's brother Enrique told the BBC: \"My brother is facing punishment in Qatar because he is gay.\" \"We will keep fighting until justice is serviced and until Manuel is safely back home.\" A Qatari official said: \"Contrary to certain media reports, no other factors were taken into account when making the arrest, and Mr Avi\u00f1a has been treated with respect and dignity throughout his detention.\" Serena Kennedy offers her \"sincere apology\" for historical \"ill-treatment and prejudice\". Wiltshire Police is investigating the incident, which took place on Monday evening. Queer Running Club says it will be the \"first ever queer and trans only running event in Hackney\". The activist and preacher accused Ousmane Sonko of \"tolerating homosexuality\" during a student forum. Once a rundown seaside town, this relatively small coastal resort has blossomed into one of the country's most exciting queer hubs. Copyright 2024 BBC.

Crowds waving Israeli flags and shouting anti-Arab slogans gathered outside the Old City\u2019s Damascus Gate before marching to the Western Wall through the Muslim Quarter - an act seen by Palestinians as a provocation. Palestinian shops along the procession route closed, amid a heavy Israeli police presence, with 3,000 officers deployed. Police later said that 18 people were arrested, including five for attacking journalists. Israel\u2019s Haaretz newspaper - whose journalist Nir Hasson was among those assaulted - reported that hundreds of young men rampaged through the Muslim Quarter before the event began, chanting \u201cDeath to Arabs\u201d and attacking Palestinians and other people.  The flag march is always tense, but fears of violence were higher this year because of the war in Gaza. Israel\u2019s far-right National Security Minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, took part in the march and said at the start that it was sending a message to Hamas that \u201cJerusalem is ours\u201d. \u201cWith the help of God, the full victory is ours,\" he added. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told a special meeting in honour of Jerusalem Day that Israel was \"surrounded by enemies\" as it had been 57 year ago. \"They thought to strangle us, to wipe us off the map. But we are an ancient people, a people of brave fighters. We stood up as one and we defended ourselves,\" he said. \"We are also doing so today against Hamas in the south, Hezbollah in the north and Iran in the east.\u201d Hamas\u2019s political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, condemned what he called the \u201crampage of settlers\u201d in Jerusalem. \u201cOur people will not rest until the occupation ends,\u201d he vowed. Jerusalem, with its major Muslim, Jewish and Christian holy sites, is at the heart of the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Israel - which occupied the formerly Jordanian-held east of the city in 1967, and effectively annexed it in 1980 in a move not recognised by most countries - regards the whole of Jerusalem as its capital. Palestinian leaders want East Jerusalem - which is home to about 350,000 Palestinians and 230,000 Israeli settlers - to be the capital of a future independent Palestinian state. On the day of the Israeli flag march in 2021, Hamas fired rockets at Jerusalem, triggering a war in Gaza that lasted 11 days. The current war began when Hamas attacked southern Israel on 7 October, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 others as hostages. At least 36,580 people have been killed in Gaza since then, the territory's Hamas-run health ministry says. One of the opponents to the mural says she is \u201cextremely concerned\u201d by the artwork. Medical charity MSF says 70 dead people have been brought to a central Gaza hospital since Tuesday. Councillors say approving the application would \u201cimpact on community cohesion\u201d. Residents of areas on the Israel-Lebanon border tell the BBC they \"feel like the forgotten people\". The plan to punish ICC officials for seeking to arrest Israeli officials could split Joe Biden's Democrats. Copyright 2024 BBC.

            "bodyText": "Sweden and Finland have moved to relax strict laws that govern the sale of alcohol, while preserving wider state monopolies.  The government in Stockholm intends to allow what it calls \"farm sales\", in which alcohol producers offer beverages directly to visiting customers.  Meanwhile, Finland's parliament has approved the sale of fermented drinks such as beer, wine and cider with an alcohol content of up to 8% in supermarkets, up from the current 5.5% limit. In Sweden and Finland, alcohol can generally only be bought in state-owned shops, or at licensed bars and restaurants.  They are the only EU countries to have alcohol monopolies. The long-standing practice is part of a wider Nordic tradition, and aims to limit consumption in the interests of public health.  Finland's MPs voted by 102 to 80 in favour of its fermented drinks law, with all members from one party in the governing coalition, the Christian Democrats, voting against. Those opposing the legislation justified their position on health grounds, amid fears of a rise in alcohol consumption. The stronger beers, wines and ciders will be available in shops as early as next week. However, the new law does not cover distilled drinks. Meanwhile Sweden's centre-right government is planning to help entrepreneurs by opening small-scale sales of wine, beer, cider and spirits to those visiting the producers' premises.  Ministers say it'll help create \"great memories\".  The measure, if approved, is expected to come into force in 2025. Both decisions may need referring to the European Commission, to check they would not breach competition law.  The Commission has already voiced objections to Finland's decision to exclude distilled beverages from its new law. Why parties on the left are heading for a lacklustre performance in European elections. Atsushi Katsuki tells the BBC the firm sees the sober generation as both a risk and an opportunity.\n BBC London's Jess Warren shares how giving up alcohol for a year is changing the way she socialises. The Oxford Artisan Distillery, opened in 2017, has rebranded and is moving to Yorkshire.

            "bodyText": "It\u2019s impossible not to be swept away by the warmth and energy in the stone-clad villages up and down the Normandy coastline this 80th anniversary of D-Day. British, US and Canadian flags flutter from garden gates and lampposts as far as the eye can see. Music from the 1940s drifts through village squares, while country lanes roar with column-upon-column of World War Two-era military jeeps. Driving them are laughing, waving men and women from all over Europe. Germans, Dutch, Belgians and Brits from all walks of life, who this week have chosen to don Second World War Allied military uniforms, to honour the 150,000 soldiers who landed here in Nazi-occupied France on 6 June 1944 - changing the course of 20th-Century Europe as they did so. How different things look now. After decades of Europeans pledging \u201cnever again\u201d, war is back on this continent on a scale not seen since World War Two, with Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Eighty years ago, Germany was the enemy. Russia, a key ally. Its pyrrhic victory on the eastern front was fundamental, like the western front Allied assault that followed D-Day, in bringing Nazi Germany to its knees. Yet this Thursday, at the official international D-Day ceremony, Germany\u2019s Chancellor Olaf Scholz will stand shoulder-to-shoulder with France\u2019s President Emmanuel Macron, US President Joe Biden and the heir to the British throne, Prince William. Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelensky has been invited too. Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin most pointedly has not. President Macron\u2019s office insists the World War Two sacrifice of the Soviet people and their contribution to victory will be honoured this year as always. But it says \u201cit will be remembered that the Eastern front was not just Russia, but also the Ukrainians, the Belarusians and all the other countries that were part of the USSR.\u201d The pain and humiliation of occupation, the deprivation of freedom facing or threatening millions in Ukraine, is something the Normands understand all too well. They make sure younger generations appreciate what Allied soldiers risked - and lost - to liberate them. The star attraction in Normandy this week is certainly not world leaders. It\u2019s the surviving D-Day veterans, the youngest of whom are now in their 90s. Wherever they travel along the coast, they\u2019re feted, photographed and fawned over, especially by the locals. I met young mum Vanessa Foulon, queuing with her six-year-old son to get a D-Day commemorative cap signed by an American veteran. Why is this so important to them, I asked?  \u201cLibert\u00e9\u201d she said simply. \u201cThey gave us our freedom.\u201d And she burst into tears. \u201cPeople here are nice,\u201d 99-year-old US veteran Donald Cobb told me. \u201cWe enjoy coming back.\u201d He\u2019d been taking part in a veterans\u2019 march in picturesque Sainte-Marie-du-Mont. The streets here are festooned with banners claiming to be \u201cthe first liberated village\u201d. Donald remembers landing on nearby Omaha beach at 05:30 on 6 June 1944. The water was choppy, the wind biting, he says. At 19, he must have been petrified.  \u201cHonestly,\u201d he said, \u201cI would rather have been anywhere else.\u201d  Yet his modesty was humbling.  \u201cWe did what we had to do,\u201d he told me. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like a hero, I\u2019m glad we were able to help. I feel good about that.\u201d France feels conflicted about its own wartime history. The country was split after it signed an armistice agreement with Nazi Germany in 1940. The Germans occupied northern France and all along the Atlantic coast, to the Spanish border. The south was managed by France\u2019s Vichy government, which collaborated with the Nazis. Yet D-Day events marking the contribution of French men and women who worked for the French Resistance seem somewhat muted, compared to the boisterous array of events commemorating Allied soldiers. \u201cI don\u2019t forget them. Please don\u2019t forget them,\u201d urged Catherine Nivromont, looking at me intently with her clear blue eyes. Catherine\u2019s brother, Pierre, was just 17 in 1944. He worked with other Resistance members, gathering intelligence on German positions along the Normandy coast, to help Allied forces plan their June assault. Pierre was in touch with locals who did German soldiers\u2019 laundry. Their clothing was marked with battalion details, revealing the quantity and location of troops. \u201cEach person played their small part,\" Catherine said. \"Under occupation, you had to resist silently, secretly. You never knew who you could trust.\u201d Both her brother, Pierre, and her father - who was also in the Resistance - were eventually betrayed by a Frenchman they had relied on to help make fake passports for Allied airmen stuck behind enemy lines. Both men were sent to Nazi concentration camps, initially to Auschwitz, and were separated afterwards. \u201cI think his homeland was more important to him than family,\u201d Catherine observed a little sadly. \u201cThe risks he took were huge.\u201d But you\u2019re proud of him, I asked?  \u201cOh, yes. So proud. That is why I see it as my job to still visit schools and universities. To tell the youth what the Resistance did, and how much they sacrificed for us.\u201d It\u2019s thought only 2% of French citizens worked full time for the Resistance, though they relied on a far broader network of people willing to help. For such a small group, they\u2019ve had a big influence on modern-day France too. Many in the Resistance were left-leaning. A large proportion, communist. After the war, they helped set up the new French Republic, implementing France\u2019s strong welfare and health system which is still firmly in place today. Back on Omaha beach, I found a group of European youngsters, energetically rehearsing a presentation of D-Day testimonies \u2013 including a French child, an Allied soldier, a frightened young German conscript and a resistance fighter - as part of Thursday\u2019s international ceremony.  Why had they volunteered for the project? As a German-Austrian national, Helena told me she felt it important to send a message of peace. \u201cFreedom for all!\u201d was the heartfelt priority for Kate from Ukraine. But 80 years on from D-Day, storm clouds hang heavy over Europe. If President Putin is victorious in Ukraine, nearby nations like Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania fear they could be next. Since World War Two, Europe has relied on the US to have its back in terms of security. But elections in Washington are fast approaching. If Donald Trump returns to the White House, he\u2019s made clear to Europe\u2019s leaders they should take nothing for granted. Additional reporting from Kathy Long and Marianne Baisnee Veteran Jim Lewis, 104, says marking anniversaries is crucial because so many men lost their lives. War veterans and residents commemorate \"the biggest thing that has ever happened on this planet\". BBC London's Nicola Ford went behind the scenes at HMS Belfast to see preparations for the big day Joe Biden says democracies are under threat, adding autocrats were \"watching happens in Ukraine\".  People attend services around Yorkshire to mark the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings. Copyright 2024 BBC.

            "bodyText": "Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 not only sparked international outrage. It also triggered a wave of sanctions designed to weaken the Kremlin\u2019s ability to wage war against its neighbour. Russia\u2019s assets abroad were frozen, its economy cut off from the global financial system, its energy exports targeted. I can remember Western officials and commentators describing the sanctions as \u201ccrippling\u201d, \u201cdebilitating\u201d and \u201cunprecedented\u201d. With adjectives like these filling the airwaves, the situation seemed clear. There was surely no way that Russia\u2019s economy would withstand the pressures. Faced with the prospect of economic collapse, the Kremlin would be forced to back down and withdraw its troops. Wouldn\u2019t it? Twenty-seven months on, the war rages on. Far from being crippled, Russia\u2019s economy is growing. The International Monetary Fund predicts that Russia will record economic growth of 3.2% this year. Caveats aside, that\u2019s still more than in any of the world\u2019s advanced economies. \u201cDebilitating\u201d sanctions have not produced shortages in the shops. Russian supermarket shelves are full. True, rising prices are a problem. And not everything that used to be on sale still is - a string of Western companies exited the Russian market in protest at the invasion of Ukraine. Listen to Steve read this article on BBC Sounds But many of their products still find their way into Russia through a variety of routes. If you look hard enough, you can still find American cola in Russian stores. CEOs from Europe and America may no longer be flocking to Russia\u2019s annual showcase economic event - but the organisers of this year\u2019s St Petersburg International Economic Forum (once referred to as Russia\u2019s Davos) claim that delegates from more than 130 countries and territories are taking part.  Instead of folding under the weight of Western sanctions, the Russian economy has been developing new markets in the East and the Global South. All of which allows Russian officials to boast that attempts to isolate Russia, politically and economically, have not succeeded. \u201cIt looks like the Russian economy managed to adjust to very unfavourable external conditions,\u201d says Yevgeny Nadorshin, senior economist at PF Capital. \u201dWithout any doubt sanctions broke a lot in the mechanism of operation inside the economy. But a lot has been restored. Adaptation is happening.\u201d Does this mean that sanctions have failed? \u201cThe big issue was our understanding of what sanctions can and cannot do,\u201d says Elina Ribakova, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \u201cIt\u2019s not like flipping a switch and Russia disappears. What sanctions can do is to throw a country off balance temporarily until it finds the way to work around the sanctions, until it finds alternative ways to get shipments, or sell its oil. We\u2019re exactly in that space where Russia has found a workaround.\u201d Moscow has redirected its oil exports from Europe to China and India. In December 2022, G7 and EU leaders introduced a price cap plan aimed at limiting the revenue Russia earns from its oil exports, by trying to keep it below $60 a barrel. But Western experts concede that Russia has been able to circumvent this quite easily. The story of the price cap highlights a dilemma for the US and its partners. Recognising that Russia is one of the largest players on the global energy market, they have tried to keep Russian oil flowing to avoid hiking energy prices. The result of that is that Moscow is still making money. \u201cIn a way, we refused to properly sanction Russian oil,\u201d Elina Ribakova concludes. \u201cThis price cap is an attempt to have our cake and eat it. The priorities are to allow Russian oil on to the market and to reduce Russia\u2019s revenue. And when these two priorities conflict, unfortunately the first one wins. That allows Russia to raise a lot of revenues and continue with the war.\u201d Russia has become China\u2019s biggest supplier of oil. But Beijing\u2019s importance for Moscow extends far beyond energy exports. China has become a lifeline for the Russian economy. Trade between the two countries hit a record $240bn (\u00a3188bn) last year. Walk around St Petersburg or Moscow and you don\u2019t need to be an expert in economics to understand how important China has become to a sanctions-hit Russia. Electronics shops here are full of Chinese tablets, gadgets and mobile phones. Chinese car dealers now dominate the local car market. Not that the Russian automobile industry is sitting twiddling its thumbs. At a business expo recently in Nizhny Novgorod, Russia\u2019s Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin was shown the brand new version of a classic Russian brand, the Volga. There was just one thing - the new Volga is based on a Chinese car, the Changan. \u201cWhere was this steering wheel made? Is it Chinese?\u201d enquired the prime minister, apparently irritated by the lack of Russian components. \u201cWe want [the wheel] to be Russian,\u201d he said. Ultimately, however, it is not the automobile industry that is driving Russia\u2019s economic growth. Military spending is doing that. Since Russia launched what the Kremlin is still calling its \u201cspecial military operation\u201d in Ukraine, armaments factories have been working round the clock and more and more Russians have been employed in the defence sector. That\u2019s driven up wages in the military-industrial complex. But spend big on the military and there\u2019s less to spend on everything else. \u201cLonger term, you are destroying the economy,\u201d believes Chris Weafer, founding partner of Eurasian consultancy firm Macro-Advisory. \u201cThere is no money going into future development.\u201d He says back in 2020 there was much discussion about the National Project programme, under which $400bn was to be spent on improving Russia\u2019s infrastructure, transportation and communications. Instead, \u201calmost all that money has been side-tracked to fund the military industrial-complex and support stability in the economy\u201d. After more than two years of fighting, Russia\u2019s economy has adapted to the pressures of war and sanctions. But the US is now threatening secondary sanctions on foreign banks aiding transactions with Moscow, and that is creating a whole new set of problems for Russia. \u201cProducts have slowed down coming into Russia,\u201d says Chris Weafer. \u201cSpare parts are more difficult to access. Every day there are stories of banks in China, Turkey and the Emirates refusing to deal with Russian transactions, whether it\u2019s money from Russia to buy goods or money going back to Russia in payment for oil or other imports. Unless this is resolved, Russia will have a financial crisis by the autumn.\u201d That\u2019s why it would be wrong to conclude that Russia has beaten sanctions. Up till now it\u2019s found ways of dealing with them, getting around them, reducing the threat from them. But the pressure on the Russian economy from sanctions hasn\u2019t gone away.

            "bodyText": "\u201cThe very soul of Europe is at risk,\u201d Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez warned fellow European centre-left politicians who had gathered in Rome ahead of a difficult EU election campaign. At stake was how to halt the seemingly unstoppable rise of right-wing and far-right parties in the European Parliament vote, which starts on Thursday in the Netherlands and continues across all 27 EU member states until Sunday. Only four EU member states have centre-left or left-wing parties in government and recent performances at the ballot box have been poor. The omens for the coming days are not good. The European left is in \u201cbad health\u201d, says Prof Marc Lazar of Sciences Po in Paris and Rome\u2019s Luiss University, the result of a steady decline that began in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The EU\u2019s centre left makes up the second largest group in the outgoing European Parliament. Known as the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D), they are projected, at best, to cling on to their 139 seats in the 720-seat parliament. It is Europe's parties on the right that have the wind in their sails, and any success the centre left achieves is likely be offset by losses elsewhere. In only four countries are the Socialists and Democrats projected to come out on top - in Sweden, Denmark, Lithuania and Malta. Even then, Denmark\u2019s Social Democrats under Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen are geared up for a big drop in support. Hers is one of only four out of 27 member states with centre-left or left-wing parties at the helm. Spain, Germany, and Malta are the others. Spain\u2019s Socialists under Pedro S\u00e1nchez and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz\u2019s Social Democrats are set to be leapfrogged by their conservative opponents - the Christian Democrats in Germany and the Popular Party (PP) in Spain. Mr Scholz\u2019s party has been steadily losing support since it won the 2021 federal elections and it is now in a battle for second place with the far-right AfD party. Pedro S\u00e1nchez is in a better position because of a controversial amnesty deal he struck with pro-independence Catalan parties. But that has also opened him up to criticism from the PP and far-right Vox. For some opposition parties on the left the situation could end up far worse, as they face being overtaken by the far right. Pawel Zerka, senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, says centre-left parties have shifted in recent years away from traditional socialist ideas towards more liberal policies, so they are now \u201ctoo similar\u201d to the centre right, who are \u201cequally pro-European, with similar positions on economic policies and climate\u201d. Latest surveys suggest most Europeans consider poverty, public health, the economy and the EU's defence and security among their top concerns. And while the S&D\u2019s manifesto promises to address these very issues, Prof Marc Lazar says for many voters it is too late, because the left failed to protect them when they had the chance.  As the left moved to the centre on socio-economic battles, the right and far right grew in strength, says Pawel Zerka. Cordons aimed at keeping the more extreme parties at bay then cemented the perception that they, rather than the left, were the real opposition to the centre. The left then started to champion issues like gender, LGBT rights or green policies: popular with urban young voters, less so with working-class families. \"In many European countries the centre left is now seen as the rich progressive elite of the cities,\" argues Mr Zerka. Some parties on the left have taken note, combining progressive and conservative policies. Denmark\u2019s Social Democrats have taken a tough stance on migration, while Romania\u2019s Social Democrats mix conservative values and Eurosceptic tendencies with centre-left economic policies. Migration has shaped and defined the European political debate over the past decade and many \u201cold left\u201d voters have looked elsewhere for solutions. France\u2019s National Rally, under Marine Le Pen and Jordan Bardella, has been more successful than most in attracting voters with its anti-migration platform. The RN is well ahead of any of its rivals in this election. A French study carried out shortly after France's 2022 elections showed that 42% of working-class men and women cast their vote for Marine Le Pen. One RN mayor said the left \u201cforgot its fundamental principles when it supported minorities rather than workers \u2013 while we defended them\u201d. Across the Alps, the Italian Democratic Party (PD) has struggled to find a coherent line to counter the anti-immigrant message of Giorgia Meloni\u2019s far-right Brothers of Italy (FdI). It remains internally fragmented and in opposition, but should come second to FdI in these elections. It is not all bad news for the left. France's Socialists have a new champion in Rapha\u00ebl Glucksmann, who has emerged as a moderate, pro-European leader out of the collapse of an alliance of left-wing parties in French elections two years ago. Moderates have long felt alienated by anti-capitalist Eurosceptic Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, who for years has been the most prominent figure of the French left. An MEP since 2019, Mr Glucksmann has no hope of catching Jordan Bardella\u2019s National Rally, but he is challenging for second place with the centrist Renew list backed by President Emmanuel Macron. Sweden\u2019s Social Democratic Party is set to obtain 30% of the vote in June, and remains the largest party in Sweden, even though a centre-right coalition is in government. But these are slim pickings for a movement that once dominated the European scene. In the past 10 years the EU has gone through events that had the potential to strengthen the traditionally pro-European left \u2013 from Covid-19 to the war in Ukraine and the fight against climate change - once the importance of a joint European response became clear.  So too, the current cost of living crisis could have been an opportunity for left-wing politicians to argue for stronger welfare measures. Part of the problem could be down to today\u2019s leaders, commentators believe. Olaf Scholz has faced accusations of dithering on Ukraine, while the head of Italy\u2019s centre left, Elly Schlein, has been criticised for being too divisive. \u201cFor a long time now, we haven't seen great left-wing leaders like Tony Blair, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der or Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand,\u201d argues Prof Lazar. \u201cNow, when we think of leadership in Europe, we think of [Hungary's Viktor] Orban, [Italy\u2019s Giorgia] Meloni, [France's Marine] Le Pen.\u201d That is why Rapha\u00ebl Glucksmann in France has attracted so much interest from voters in a relatively short time, and why he\u2019s promising supporters to be the \u201cgreat, big surprise\u201d of this election. Ahead of Saturday's international friendly in Mallorca, BBC Sport looks back at the two occasions when Northern Ireland stunned the football world by beating European powerhouses Spain. The polling stations will be open to Polish citizens to cast their votes on Sunday. Some 373 million voters can take part in the 6-9 June vote across the EU's 27 countries.

            "bodyText": "Mary Njambi Koikai, better known as Jahmby Koikai, dedicated most of her short life to telling her fellow Kenyans about the debilitating condition of endometriosis, which led to her death this week aged just 38. As a popular radio host and reggae DJ, she had the perfect platform. Bravely, she shared her struggles, often calling those in authority to account, demanding better healthcare for women, especially those struggling with the menstrual disorder. \u201cPeople really identified with her suffering, with her pain,\u201d fellow activist Doris Murimi told the BBC. From the tender age of 13, she experienced a regular monthly torment, an excruciating pain that came with her menstrual cycle. However, it took 17 years to know exactly what she was suffering from and get a proper diagnosis for the condition. That was because of the lack of local facilities specialising in the treatment of endometriosis. Endometriosis is a gynaecological condition associated with menstruation where tissue similar to the lining of the womb develops in other areas of the body, including the fallopian tubes, pelvis, bowel, vagina and intestines.  Endometriosis is not considered fatal, but in rare instances it can cause life-threatening complications. Symptoms include severe to debilitating pain often in the pelvic area, fatigue, and heavy periods. In rare cases it can also appear in other parts of the body including the lungs, brain, and skin. Ms Koikai\u2019s was one of those extreme cases, with her condition worsening over the years, especially as her reproductive organs matured. It affected her schooling, relationships, work and many other aspects of her life. She recounted to the BBC in 2020 that at one point while in university, she sat an exam but couldn\u2019t write anything because of the pain. She had to repeat some years, delaying her graduation. In 2015, her lung collapsed from thoracic endometriosis, a rare manifestation of the disease. The condition would recur in subsequent months and years, often requiring specialised surgery. One of the most enduring images of Ms Koikai is of her in a hospital bed with her upper body heavily bandaged, and many tubes along the right side of the chest. This was in 2018, when she already had a series of lung collapses and surgeries. She had been admitted to a specialised hospital in the US and was fundraising for the expensive treatment. She was weak and in a lot of pain. \u201cI will not describe the pain because I lack words that aptly fit what I\u2019ve been through,\u201d she said at the time. The condition had ravaged her body. At the US hospital, tissue that had grown because of the endometriosis was removed from her uterus, bowel areas and ovaries. The biggest challenge, she said, was her lungs. It had spread so much, partly because of the way it had previously been managed back home that the surgeon in the US could not \u201cbelieve all what had been done\u201d. \u201cThe scar tissue and the placement of wrong chest tubes [in Kenya] created this mess,\u201d she said. Despite her many scars, she was still smiling. \u201cDeep scars. Raw scars.\" As she described it, \u201ceach of the scars told a story. I see all I\u2019ve battled. Emotionally. Mentally. Physically.\u201d Yet she chose to battle her condition with fortitude, while publicly raising awareness of the condition. Ms Koikai was born in 1986 on the outskirts of the capital, Nairobi. She was raised by her mother and grandmother, who taught her to be patient and tough in every life\u2019s situation. She had always wanted to be a broadcaster from early on. Despite her condition, she managed to complete her university studies and become a popular radio host and a reggae DJ \u2013 also known as Fyah Mummah to her fans. It\u2019s possible that most people in Kenya got to know of the condition because of her.  Doris Murimi, the founder of Endo Sisters East Africa, a non-government organisation that raises awareness about the condition, was one of the panellists in one of the forums on a local TV station when Ms Koikai first publicly narrated her story. She said that until then, many people did not seem to understand endometriosis, even when her organisation went out to train and talk to people. After that, \u201cshe was always the reference point, so basically she really was the face of endometriosis awareness in this country\u201d, Ms Murimi told the BBC. Endometriosis affects about 10% (190 million) of women and girls of reproductive age globally, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). There is no known cure, so treatment is usually just controlling the symptoms. But Ms Koikai admitted that the \u201cbiggest challenge\u201d for people with endometriosis was \u201cmisdiagnosis and with this comes botched surgeries, wrong medication\u201d. That\u2019s what she had gone through, she said, with doctors having to deal with the damage caused due to misdiagnosis before managing the disease. She stayed about two years in the US while doctors treated her. Then and through the years that followed, she chronicled her experience, which made many people engage and identify with the condition. Ms Murimi believes that by living and sharing her story, Ms Koikai had moved the country to understand what was a complex thing to comprehend. Many other people have paid tribute to her strength in speaking up for women suffers from endometriosis. Comedian Senje, who also has the condition, says the encouragement she received from Ms Koikai was invaluable in her own struggle. \u201cYou gave me strength every single time I felt like giving up, I looked up to you because I believed if you made it then I would too... My heart is broken,\u201d said the comedian whose real name is Sylvia Savai. Dennis Itumbi, a strategist in Kenya's ruling coalition, noted Ms Koikai\u2019s efforts to create awareness even up to her last days. \u201cIn your final days, you pushed to understand and raise awareness about the dilemma many girls face - thoracic endometriosis. You died educating and motivating me,\u201d he wrote. On 20 May, she put up her final post on Instagram addressed to President William Ruto, calling for better access to health \u201cfor millions of women battling endometriosis in silence\u201d. She died two weeks later in a Nairobi hospital from complications linked to the condition. In the end, her life, her struggle and campaign made a difference. \u201cA lot has changed, thanks to Koikai,\u201d said Ms Murimi, noting that since last year, there was \u201can endometriosis centre\u2026and we have like two or three top specialists\u201d. But the fight to address menstrual disorders will continue, she said. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

            "bodyText": "Three rusty water-trucks stand at the edge of Kibbutz Malkiya, on Israel\u2019s border with Lebanon; little bigger than a family car, they look like something out of an old cartoon. A collection of industrial leaf-blowers is stacked nearby. \u201cThis is all we have,\u201d resident Dean Sweetland explains. \u201cWe have just these - and the leaf-blowers - to blow the fire back onto the dead areas.\u201d Dean, a Londoner who moved to the kibbutz eight years ago, is one of a dozen residents left to tackle recent bushfires in the area, sparked by Hezbollah rockets from Lebanon. \u201cWe\u2019re on our own,\u201d he says. \u201cThe flames can be six metres tall. Sometimes you just can\u2019t get near it.\u201d He gestures to the leaf-blowers standing in the sun. \u201cAnd we\u2019re fighting it with gardening tools.\u201d Over the past few days, footage of the fires has made headlines in Israel. The blazes, triggered when Hezbollah rockets hit dry undergrowth in soaring summer temperatures, have burned through 3,500 acres, according to forest administrators. Monday was \u201ca battle day\u201d, said Israel\u2019s Fire and Rescue Commissioner, Eyal Caspi, with 94 fires burning across these northern hills. Most are now out, or under control, but rockets fly over homes here several times a day and each one carries the potential to spark a new blaze. And there are places at the moment where firefighters don\u2019t go. \u201cThere is a war here and in a war zone, operations are different,\u201d Mr Caspi told Israel\u2019s Kan News radio station. \u201cIn certain areas, where there is no immediate danger to human life... where the army knows that the firefighters can get hurt, it gives us the instruction not to enter. And I back it up.\u201d From the back terrace of his home - built from shipping containers, a few hundred meters from the Lebanese border - Dean Sweetland points out the plumes of grey smoke rising from the hills nearby, to the sound of distant bombs and fighter jets. Most of the other residents of Kibbutz Malkiya were evacuated in the days following the Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October, when its Hezbollah allies in Lebanon began firing on communities here. Both armed groups are labelled as terrorist organisations by Israel, the US and others. But Dean, who used to serve in the British Army, stayed on. He is part of a group of residents from border communities who race to put out the fires that fire crews are blocked from accessing. The Israeli army, he says, is not a solution. \u201cEspecially when we\u2019re in the line of sight for Hezbollah, they\u2019ll see the soldiers and send a rocket,\u201d he says. \u201cWe hear the drones when we\u2019re putting the fires out.\u201d In the early days of the war, Dean says, tanks were parked around the kibbutz and attracting a lot of Hezbollah fire. They\u2019ve now left, and in between the bombardments, the kibbutz is peaceful. But Dean and his neighbours feel the emptiness. Families evacuated eight months ago are still living in temporary accommodation further south. The blazes here are a vivid reminder that the Israeli government\u2019s promise to secure these northern areas and get residents back home is still unfulfilled. \u201cWe feel like we\u2019re the forgotten people,\u201d Dean says. \u201cThey don\u2019t care about the north.\u201d The attitude among many in the country, he says, is \u201clet it burn\u201d. \u201cI think we have to take out Hezbollah for 10km, maybe more,\u201d says Yariv Rozenberg, the deputy commander of Kibbutz Malkiya\u2019s civil defence team. \u201cYou can\u2019t kill them all, and they won\u2019t leave from here. But we need more army here, and we need to go back to our life \u2013 to bring our families back.\u201d As the months go by, pressure is mounting on Israel\u2019s government to resolve this conflict and get people home. Israel\u2019s far-right security minister this week called for Israel to burn \u201call Hezbollah strongholds: destruction, war!\u201d Others have been more measured. War with Hezbollah would be a much more difficult and dangerous conflict than the one Israel is fighting in Gaza. Hezbollah\u2019s deputy chief, Sheikh Naim Qassem, told the Al Jazeera television station that the group was not seeking to widen the conflict but that any Israeli expansion of the war would be met \u201cwith devastation\u201d. Before a meeting of the war cabinet to discuss the situation on Tuesday night, the Israeli military\u2019s chief of staff, Lt Gen Herzi Halevi, said the country was \u201capproaching the point where a decision will have to be made\u201d. The armed forces, he said, were \u201cprepared and ready to move to an offensive\u201d. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, visiting troops and firefighters in the northern town of Kiryat Shmona on Wednesday, said the government was prepared for \u201ca very strong action in the north.\u201d \u201cOne way or another we will restore security to the north,\u201d he said. Many believe a ceasefire in Gaza would help cool the situation further north. \u201cGaza is the key,\u201d Dean says. \u201cIt needs to be dealt with, one way or the other. Then Hezbollah will stop, because they\u2019re doing this in support of Hamas.\u201d The northern conflict is closely linked to the war in Gaza. For the past eight months, with the focus on Gaza, Israel\u2019s leader has tried to keep this conflict contained. Now he\u2019s facing a glaring reminder of this other front: caught between the war he hasn\u2019t finished in the south, and the war he doesn\u2019t necessarily want to start. One of the opponents to the mural says she is \u201cextremely concerned\u201d by the artwork. The Israeli military said it struck a \"Hamas compound\" in the school - a claim Hamas officials deny. Tens of thousands took part in the Jerusalem Day flag march, seen as a provocation by Palestinians. Councillors say approving the application would \u201cimpact on community cohesion\u201d. Local media report that there was a 30-minute shootout; the attacker's motive is unclear. Copyright 2024 BBC.

            "bodyText": "For thousands of years, alcohol has been used as a social lubricant. In Japan, it is known as nommunication - a combination of the Japanese word for drink, nomu, and communication. The idea is that drinking alcohol creates a more relaxed environment. Businesses have even tackled difficult issues in pubs, rather than conference rooms. The late former chairman of then-bankrupt Japan Airlines, Kazuo Inamori, explained in 2012 how he used beer to get his employees to open up. But there is now a whole new generation that chooses not to drink as much. Multiple studies in the UK, the US and Australia show that people from Gen Z are more sober than their parents and grandparents. In Japan, faced with declining alcohol tax revenues, the authorities even arranged a national competition, named Sake Viva!, in an effort to reverse the trend in 2022. The sober generation does not only affect Japan's tax revenues, it also offers a whole new challenge for businesses that make and sell alcohol.  \"We have realised that younger people are increasingly choosing not to drink as much alcohol,\" said Atsushi Katsuki, the chief executive officer of Asahi Group Holdings.  However, Japan's biggest brewer sees this as both a risk and an opportunity.  \"Our firm is quite unique because while the majority of our sales comes from beer and alcoholic beverages, we also have the capability to produce non-alcoholic beverages or soft drinks which gives us a competitive advantage,\" he said. Asahi is also pushing its non-alcoholic and what it refers to as low alcohol offerings - such as alcohol-free beer or drinks with less than 3.5% alcohol - outside of its home market. \"By 2030, we want to double the share of beverages with zero or low alcohol to 20% of our overall beverage sales,\" he said. They are already popular in its home market. Mr Katsuki said that alcohol-free beers account for 10% of Asahi's beverages sales in Japan as people avoid drink driving.  But the Japanese market is shrinking because of an ageing population and falling birth rates. \"Alcoholic beverages sales in Japan will continue to decline because we cannot go against the shrinking population, which means we cannot expect the Japanese market to grow massively,\" he said. That means Asahi's main growth opportunities are overseas, and it has been expanding rapidly abroad for 15 years. Today, more than half of its sales are generated outside Japan. One major market the firm has yet to tap is the US. The question is: can alcohol-free beer get as popular there as it is in Japan? Vincent Ball and Samantha Benaitis are a 20-year-old couple who live in Jacksonville, Florida. In the US, laws relating to alcohol vary in different states but the minimum age for purchasing it is 21 across the country. While those above the age of 40 in their families enjoy boozy nights, the Gen Zers do not drink much alcohol. \"I think drinking in moderation is perfectly fine,\" said Vincent, adding that he would enjoy having a beer after work but \"not crazy parties\". \"I just find other things more enjoyable, and I don't find drinking very important, especially in party settings.\" For Samantha, it was a lesson learnt from seeing others drinking heavily. \"I definitely was influenced by everybody around me in my life getting way too drunk or hammered, and making mistakes that impact them for a lifetime rather than just for that night.\" So instead, Samantha drinks kombucha - a fermented black or green tea, which is often flavoured - because \"if you're just drinking water, I've been asked many times, oh, are you really just drinking water?\" To avoid peer pressure, would they drink alcohol-free beer? Their answer was a resounding \"no\". Asked how Asahi would tackle new, non-drinking, consumers like Samantha and Vincent, Mr Katsuki said the firm has learned an important lesson. \"We realised that we have been producing non-alcoholic beverages from the point of view of alcohol drinkers,\" he said, admitting that Asahi has not yet been particularly successful in appealing to non-drinkers. \"We\u2019ve been collecting data in Japan by asking those who cannot or choose not to drink alcohol to understand what kind of products they want.\" In a sign of uphill battle drinks companies face as they try to win over Gen Z, Vincent's younger sister, Josie, explained how she feels about people getting drunk. \"I definitely understand people who overdrink. Would I do it myself? I hope not because people kind of tend to make a fool of themselves when they overdrink.\" If you, or someone you know, has been affected by issues with alcohol, the BBC Action Line has details of organisations which may be able to help. Both countries currently have some of the strictest alcohol laws in Europe. Toyota has apologised for providing incorrect or manipulated data for safety certification tests. A state visit to the UK by the Emperor and Empress of Japan is to go ahead during the election campaign. The duo beat another pair by eight minutes to win a share of \u00a320,000.  Punters are likely not getting the full amount of alcohol they are paying for, a new study suggests. Copyright 2024 BBC.

            "bodyText": "After Israeli forces pulled out of Gaza City\u2019s vast al-Shifa hospital complex on 1 April, following their second raid there, stunned Palestinians who pored over the burnt-out ruins said it reeked of death. During the past eight months of war, hospitals have come under repeated attack, with Israel claiming they are used as bases by Hamas; something the group denies.  But events at al-Shifa \u2013 once the biggest and best equipped medical facility in the Gaza Strip \u2013 have arguably been the most dramatic. The two-week surprise raid, launched after Israel said Hamas had regrouped at the site, was described by the Israeli government as \"precise and surgical\". Its spokesman, Avi Hyman, asserted that it had set \"the gold standard of urban warfare\". He said: \u201cWe took out over 200 terrorists. We apprehended over 900 terrorists with not a single civilian casualty.\u201d With decaying bodies sticking out of the sand piled up by combat bulldozers in the courtyards of al-Shifa, the claim that there had been no civilian casualties was immediately questioned. In recent weeks, four mass graves have been uncovered at the site, with Palestinian search teams saying that several hundred bodies have been found.  We have worked with a journalist in Gaza to follow developments. \u201cWe\u2019ve extracted martyrs, many of whom are decomposed and completely unidentifiable,\u201d a Palestinian Civil Defence worker, Rami Dababesh told us grimly on 8 May as he stood by a line of white plastic body bags at al-Shifa, wearing a face mask and full protective gear. \u201cWe\u2019ve found corpses of women, children and individuals without heads as well as torn body parts,\u201d he added. The Civil Defence lacks forensic equipment and expertise, but its teams have been using photos and videos to document the remains. A director, Dr Mohamed Mughir, told us there were suspicious finds; describing how \u201csigns of field executions, binding marks, gunshot wounds to the head and torture marks on the limbs were observed on the bodies of some martyrs\". The UN Security Council has expressed \u201cdeep concern\u201d at the discovery of mass graves at both al-Shifa and Nasser hospital in southern Gaza. Along with the US and the European Union, it has called for an independent investigation into possible war crimes. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) says that during its raids of the Gaza hospitals, its soldiers exhumed bodies that Palestinians had buried earlier as part of its search for the remains of some 250 hostages captured during the deadly Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October.  It maintains bodies were examined respectfully and those not belonging to Israeli captives were returned to their place.  However, at least some of the corpses found recently at al-Shifa were those of patients who died during Israel\u2019s latest military action. A paramedic involved in the search said some had IV catheters still attached. On 15 April, the BBC met two men whose dead mothers were last seen being treated at the hospital. Their bodies had just been recovered from a mass grave. \u201cI came running here when they told me of the grave,\u201d said Mohammed al-Khatib, who had spent days searching for his mother, Khawla. \u201cBy the grace of almighty God her body was found.\u201d Walid Fteima said his elderly mother, Lina Abu Leila, was being treated for malnutrition and severe dehydration when she died. Her body was decomposed, and he could only identify her from injuries she had from an Israeli bombing last year. \u201c[She] had a toe amputated on each foot,\u201d he explained. After it began its operation at the hospital early on 18 March, the IDF ordered thousands of civilians sheltering there and living in the vicinity to leave and head south. However, it said the hospital could continue to function. By the end of two weeks, only some 140 patients and medics reportedly remained. The local WHO representative, Dr Rik Peeperkorn, says this group endured \u201chorrific conditions\u201d. After being repeatedly moved around the complex, he says, they \u201cactually ended up in the human resources building which was completely unfit for treatment\". Ultimately, he says, 20 patients died. Several surviving patients \u2013 all wounded in previous Israeli strikes \u2013 told us they were given only tiny quantities of food such as canned tuna. They said there were severe shortages of drinking water and medication. \u201cThe bombing surrounded us 24/7,\u201d said Mohamed al-Nadeem who is half paralysed. \u201cI am sick and unable to move. I was sleeping on the floor without blankets.\u201d  \u201cThere were no dressings or painkillers,\u201d said Rafif Doghmush, 15, whose foot has been amputated. The IDF has told journalists that no staff or patients died as a \u201cdirect result\u201d of its action, but that some may have died of \u201cnatural causes\".  During its raid, it said it helped patients by moving them out of harm\u2019s way and that medical supplies and devices as well as food, water, and a generator were brought to the hospital. Grainy drone footage shared by the IDF after it launched its raid on 18 March showed Palestinian gunmen apparently shooting at soldiers from inside al-Shifa hospital. Later, the gunmen were said to have barricaded themselves in wards and corridors, opening fire and throwing explosives. Three Israeli soldiers were confirmed to have been killed during the two-week long operation. The IDF briefed journalists that its action at the hospital was taken based on \u201cconcrete intelligence\u201d that Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad had taken over parts of the site, suggesting their operatives had been using it to access basic supplies as well as power and the internet. While Hamas denied using al-Shifa as a base, its officials did not deny the presence of some members inside the complex, indicating that they may have been among displaced people sheltering there. Israel has said that \u201cover 200 terrorists\u201d were killed in and around al-Shifa, as well as the hundreds detained, but has only given some names. These include Faiq al-Mabhouh, described as head of operations in Hamas\u2019 internal security service. The Hamas-run government\u2019s media office said he was a police commander who had been co-ordinating aid deliveries to northern Gaza. Others killed were identified as a senior Hamas commander, Raed Thabet, said to have been head of recruitment and supply acquisition, and Mahmoud Zakzouk, said to have been deputy commander of the Hamas rocket unit in Gaza City. Two other Hamas operatives were named as Fadi Dweik and Zakaria Najib, said to have been involved in organising attacks in the occupied West Bank. In April, the IDF also released footage which it said was from the interrogation of Tarek Abu Shaluf, spokesman for the political wing of Islamic Jihad. It said he had been captured at al-Shifa. Hamas and Islamic Jihad do not routinely confirm the names of low-level fighters killed by Israeli military action, making it very difficult to estimate how many were killed at the hospital and in the vicinity. It is likely that a number were among the dead found in mass graves. Despite the Israeli claim that there was \u201cnot a single civilian casualty\u201d from its raid, we have been given strong testimony that there were Palestinian civilians killed by heavy Israeli bombardment and intense shooting in the surrounding neighbourhood. The Palestinian Civil Defence told us that hundreds of Palestinians were still reported to be missing following the raid in March. There have repeatedly been conflicting narratives about what has happened in and around al-Shifa. During its first controversial raid there, the Israeli military raised expectations that Israeli hostages might be found at the site. It also released a graphic depicting a vast underground tunnel network that it suggested was underneath the hospital, serving as a major Hamas command and control centre. While the IDF said it retrieved the bodies of two Israeli hostages near to the hospital, it did not announce that it had found any within the complex. Security camera footage that was recovered did show that at least two foreign captives were taken there on 7 October. The IDF showed what it said was a fortified 55-metre tunnel on the hospital grounds. This fell short of its initial claims about the extent of hidden tunnels, although later reporting suggested the passage \u2013 which was blown up \u2013 had actually been longer and was most likely connected to a wider network under Gaza City. When it returned to the site in March, the IDF suggested its key discoveries were of a different nature, releasing pictures of cash, weapons, and ammunition it said it had found there along with Hamas documents. Al-Shifa has been at the heart of a debate about whether Hamas uses medical sites as a cover. Israel has consistently claimed that the group hides its fighters and infrastructure behind the sick and wounded, which it suggests has rendered hospitals legitimate military targets. Hamas denies misusing civilian sites and accuses Israel of violating international humanitarian law by targeting hospitals. In April, when the UN called for \u201ca clear, transparent and credible investigation\u201d of mass graves in Gaza, its spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters that more journalists needed to be able to work safely in the territory to report on the facts. During the war, Israel and Egypt have denied free access to foreign media. Mr Dujarric also said: \u201cIt\u2019s important that all forensic evidence be well preserved.\u201d So far, that is proving to be a challenge. International forensic specialists have been unable to reach Gaza to investigate what happened at al-Shifa. That has left much of the focus locally on registering and identifying the dead where possible, and giving them proper burials. The disturbance of the mass grave sites, experts say, will ultimately make it much harder to uncover the truth about them. Meanwhile, although al-Shifa has been largely destroyed, there have been recent efforts to restart very limited medical services on site. These gained momentum as Israel targeted other health facilities which it said were being used by Hamas, particularly Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza. In late May, in a hastily repaired room of the kidney dialysis unit at al-Shifa, the journalist working with us met four patients as they sat connected to steadily beeping machines. After so many deaths at the hospital, it is once again providing some life-saving treatment. One of the opponents to the mural says she is \u201cextremely concerned\u201d by the artwork. The Israeli military said it struck a \"Hamas compound\" in the school - a claim Hamas officials deny. Tens of thousands took part in the Jerusalem Day flag march, seen as a provocation by Palestinians. The student union says it would be \"logistically impossible\" to hold the event. Councillors say approving the application would \u201cimpact on community cohesion\u201d. Copyright 2024 BBC.

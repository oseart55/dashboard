    "article_text": "The USS Harry S. Truman, a nuclear-power aircraft carrier, is pictured off the coast of Miami on Sunday, May 5, 2024. The ship was visiting MiamiÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s Fleet Week during its ongoing train up to prepare it to deploy to the Red Sea later this year. (Corey Dickstein/Stars and Stripes)  MIAMI Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u20ac� The USS Harry S. Truman will soon lead a Navy strike group into the volatile Red Sea, where U.S. sailors have fought almost daily for months to down drones and missiles launched by Houthi rebels from Yemen.  The nuclear-powered aircraft carrier and its 6,000-some sailors have spent recent months training in the western Atlantic Ocean for that mission Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u20ac� a rare, pre-planned deployment expected to take the ship into a hostile environment. In recent weeks, its sailors have been undergoing flight deck testing, its pilots knowing that later this year they will be tasked with shooting down drones and munitions launched by the Iran-backed Houthis.  Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cThey know that theyÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢re most likely going to be entering a weapon engagement zone,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ said Adm. Daryl Caudle, the leader of U.S. Navy Fleet Forces Command. Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cI believe, personally, that puts higher stakes on why what we do [in training] is so important. Ã¢â\u201a¬Â¦ For this group, this [deployment] is not with the mindset that theyÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢re just going to go drill holes in the water somewhere Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u20ac� this is, Ã¢â\u201a¬ËœWeÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢re going to be employed for combat.Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢ Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½  But with combat on the minds of the TrumanÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s sailors and preparations being made to deploy to the hostile waters of the Red Sea, the 1,000-foot-long, 104,000-ton aircraft carrier made a rare appearance in Miami to have the shipÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s sailors participate recently in the cityÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s first Fleet Week.  Sailors aboard the USS Bataan, an amphibious assault ship, look out at the USS Truman aircraft carrier as the Bataan pulls into the port of Miami for Fleet Week on Sunday, May 5, 2024. (Corey Dickstein/Stars and Stripes)  There was some Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cpushbackÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ from Navy planners, Caudle admitted. An aircraft carrier had never participated in a U.S. Fleet Week anywhere. But when Fleet Week kicked off May 5, the Truman sat stoic, anchored just a few miles off the coast of Miami Beach Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u20ac� its sailors gathered on the flight deck to wave emphatically at their counterparts aboard the USS Bataan, as the amphibious assault ship entered MiamiÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s port.  Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cI will admit that bringing a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier to a Fleet Week is unique,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ said Caudle, who is charged with providing trained and ready naval forces to combatant commanders around the world. Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cAnd of course ... theyÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢re [in the middle of] doing the training Ã¢â\u201a¬Â¦ they need to do to ensure that theyÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢re certified and qualified and proficient and ready to go fight. Fleet Week is not built into that.Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½  The crew used the voyage from its home base in Norfolk, Va., to Miami and back Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u20ac� the Truman returned Friday to Norfolk Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u20ac� to conduct extra tactical training at sea, Caudle said. The carrierÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s time in Miami was largely meant to give sailors a fun port call and to interact with the local community, a sort-of recruiting effort that top Navy officials, including Caudle, said they hoped would spark interest in the sea service among more young Miamians.  The admiral said he hoped the Fleet Week stop, wedged into a critical train-up for what would likely be the most dangerous deployment most of the sailors have ever served, would spark memories of their service and bolster their quality of life in the Navy.  Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cOnce they actually come over to the city, and immerse themselves into this incredible town, and get to experience the food, and the people, and the nightlife and all that, that is what builds the memories, and [that is] why people stay in the Navy,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ Caudle said. Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cIÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢m going to be honest; this is what I remember from my almost 40-year career are the places IÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢ve pulled into. The operations tend to be a bit of a blur, but you really remember the port calls.Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½  With Fleet Week over, the bulk of the TrumanÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s preparations begin.  Navy officials declined to say precisely when the Truman will embark on its cross-Atlantic voyage toward the Red Sea to replace the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower, which deployed from Norfolk in October. Caudle said the deployment was still Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cseveral months out.Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ The Eisenhower briefly left the Red Sea last month for the Mediterranean Sea, but it has recently returned to the Red Sea, according to the Navy.  Naval Air Crewman 2nd Class Matthew Watkins, a native of Anthem, Ariz., attached to the Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cDragonslayersÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ of Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron 11, sits in an MH-60S Sea Hawk helicopter as it prepares to launch from the flight deck of the Nimitz-class aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman on April 25, 2024, in the Atlantic Ocean. (Michael Shen/U.S. Navy)  The Navy canceled a planned visit to the Truman for news reporters during the Miami Fleet Week, and the shipÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s top leaders were not made available for interviews.  Caudle said he was confident in the shipÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s ongoing preparations. The Navy was already incorporating Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201clessons learnedÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ in the Truman crewÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s training from the Eisenhower strike groupÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s fighting with the Houthis.  While the admiral declined to provide specifics about most of those new lessons, he said they are informing the scenarios that the Truman has faced in its training. Ultimately, as the carrier completes its pre-deployment training, the ship will deal with similar issues that the Eisenhower and its escort ships have faced in the Red Sea, Caudle said. Those include lessons on some strategies such as where a strike groupÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s ships should be in relation to one another, how its radar systems should be tuned and the decision-making processes on which weapon should be employed against which incoming munition and when, he said.  Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cWeÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢re taking all these lessons from [the Eisenhower] strike group in real time Ã¢â\u201a¬Â¦ and bringing all those lessons weÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢ve learned to bear in the scenarios that we use against Truman to make sure that is the most relevant set that we can build for them,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ Caudle said.  The Eisenhower and her strike group have faced nearly six months of fighting in the Red Sea. While the groupÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s destroyers have been credited with taking down many of the drones and missiles fired by Houthi rebels into crowded shipping lanes, the EisenhowerÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s aircraft have flown near constant missions in the area, Navy officials have said. The carrierÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s fighter planes have shot down drones and missiles and launched so-called Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cdynamic strikes,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ often to take out ballistic missiles that appear ready for launch, Pentagon officials have said in recent months.  Truman will bring some 90 aircraft, including F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jets, E-2D Hawkeye command and control aircraft, E/A18 Growler electronic warfare jets, and MH-60 Seahawk helicopters.  It will likely enter conditions that another top admiral described this week as the most volatile that Navy sailors on deployed ships have faced since World War II.  Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cThey have to be prepared on a momentÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s notice to conduct engagements,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ Rear Adm. Fred Pyle, the serviceÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s surface warfare director, said Tuesday at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank in Washington. Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cAnd they have to get it right every single time.Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½  Sailors conduct flight operations on the flight deck of the Nimitz-class aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman on April 24, 2024, in the Atlantic Ocean. (Matthew Nass/U.S. Navy)  Pyle and Caudle said they have been impressed with the Eisenhower strike groupÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s successes in the Red Sea, where the ships are leading a coalition of some 24 nations supporting Operation Prosperity Guardian, the international mission to thwart the Houthi attacks. The rebel group, which receives its arms and other support from Iran, has claimed the attacks are in response to IsraelÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s ongoing war against Hamas in Gaza, which was launched after the surprise attack by Hamas militants on Israeli civilians in October.  U.S. Central Command, which oversees American military operations in the Middle East including the Red Sea, has sent out near daily readouts of engagements between coalition Navy personnel and the Houthis. Pyle said the operations successes have bolstered confidence in the systems that the service has invested in to protect sailors aboard its ships.  Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cThe threats theyÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢re engaging [in the Red Sea] are unmanned, theyÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢re anti-ship cruise missiles, theyÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢re anti-ship ballistic missiles, and in each one of those threat groups weÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢re performing well,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ Pyle said. Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cAnd the systems and the sailors are performing as designed and great.Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½  Caudle said he expected the Truman strike group would seamlessly pick up the mission and perform just as well as the Eisenhower group has to date. Talking to the shipÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s sailors, the admiral said, he can sense they are ready to get in the fight.  Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cI think people join a combat service, you know, to be part of a combat team,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ Caudle said. Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cThey want to go and actually exercise that and do what they do for a living and Ã¢â\u201a¬Â¦ be stressed to the ultimate limit out there.  Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cIn the Red Sea right now, weÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢re bringing the full complement of naval combat power to bear. ... But we want to deter conflict. That is the main effort. There is nothing that does that more than 100,000 tons of diplomacy in an aircraft carrier.Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½",

    "article_text": "This audio is created with AI assistance  Support independent journalism in Ukraine. Join us in this fight. Become a member Support us just once  Russia tested a space-based anti-satellite weapon with potential nuclear capabilities in 2022, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported on May 16, citing unnamed U.S. officials.  The officials said that Russia had launched a satellite into space in February 2022 to test components for a potential anti-satellite weapon that would carry a nuclear device. However, the satellite that was launched doesnÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢t carry a nuclear weapon, the WSJ reported.  The U.S. House Intelligence Committee warned in February of a \"serious\" but unspecified security threat from Russia. Reports then followed that the threat relates to Russia's desire to \"put a nuclear weapon into space.\"  U.S. President Joe Biden later said that Moscow was indeed developing an anti-satellite space weapon, but it did not endanger people on Earth. He added that there had not yet been a decision to launch the weapon into space.  The Russian satellite, named the Cosmos-2553, was launched in February 2022 and has been orbiting Earth since then, operating as a platform to test \"nonnuclear components of the new weapon system,\" officials told the WSJ.  Russian officials have claimed that the Cosmos-2553 is \"intended for scientific research,\" which the U.S. officials say is unlikely. The Kremlin has previously denied that it has any intention to put nuclear weapons in space.  If Cosmos-2553 or a similar satellite were equipped with nuclear weapons, it could destroy hundreds of satellites in low orbit with a blast.  Outgoing Pentagon official John Plumb told Congress that it would be an \"indiscriminate weapon\" that has no \"national boundaries, (and) doesn't determine between military satellites, civilian satellites, or commercial satellites.\"  Moscow has repeatedly resorted to nuclear saber-rattling throughout the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.  Critics say such statements are bluffs instead of Russia's genuine plans and are intended to scare the West into making concessions.",

    "article_text": "A nuclear war expert who claims we are getting closer to atomic warfare says it would take 72 minutes to wipe out five billion people if the worst comes to pass.  Investigative journalist Annie Jacobsen, from Connecticut, who is a New York Times bestselling author, and a 2016 Pulitzer Prize finalist, joined Steven Bartlett on The Diary of a CEO podcast just how close we are to nuclear war.  Since she started writing her book Nuclear War: A Scenario, in 2020 she said: 'The geopolitical temperature of the world has escalated to a point that you have not seen in your lifetime and I haven't seen in my lifetime.'  In the month that her book was published Russian president Putin moved nuclear weapons into Belarus, claiming it is a precautionary measure for 'anyone thinking of inflicting a strategic defeat' on Russia.  Annie said: 'If a nuclear exchange happens - and we're talking strategic ballistic missiles - it will not stop until the world ends and we are talking about in seconds and minutes not in days and weeks and months.'  Nuclear war expert Annie Jacobsen, from Connecticut , US, revealed we are getting closer to atomic warfare on The Diary of a CEO podcast  Annie, who interviewed former secretaries of defense, a former nuclear sub Commander and a former cyber Chief, revealed they all said that 'the nuclear threat is always there.'  She said: During the previous administration, former president Trump, there was this presidential rhetoric going on, you may recall - fire and fury Trump and the leader of North Korea threatening this kind of thing. And like many I'm sure began to wonder, \"My God what if deterrence, another word for prevention, fails?\" and that is the question that I put to all of those sources in the book.'  The investigative journalist went on to explain that the president of the United States has 'sole presidential authority to launch a nuclear weapon.'  She said: 'What does that mean? It's exactly like it sounds, it's \"solo presidential\". He's the POTUS authority. He doesn't have to ask anyone for permission not the SEF, not the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, not the Congress.'  Explaining why this power would be given to just one person, she explained: 'It has to do with the ticking clock of it.'  'An ICBM (intercontinental ballistic missile) travels from one continent to the next in roughly 30 minutes carrying a nuclear warhead to strike a target.  'There are only 30 minutes, this isn't like, \"Hey guys should we go have a war in Iraq. Let's discuss this, let's debate\", this is: \"There is a ballistic missile sir coming at the United States and you must act\" and that's why, in the simplest layman's terms, sole presidential authority exists.'  Annie, who is a New York Times bestselling author, and a 2016 Pulitzer Prize finalist, joined Steven Bartlett (pictured) on The Diary of a CEO podcast just how close we are to nuclear war  Since she started writing her book Nuclear War: A Scenario, in 2020 she said: 'The geopolitical temperature of the world has escalated to a point that you have not seen in your lifetime and I haven't seen in my lifetime'  Annie revealed she wanted to write the book because people have become complacent about the threat of Nuclear Wa,r and some may not even know what that would mean to their lives.  She said: 'I wanted to show in horrific detail just how horrible, just how apocalyptic nuclear war will be because I think many people have forgotten, or don't know to begin with, the consequences of a nuclear exchange.'  Annie sourced information from defense department documents and defense scientists to be able to determine precisely what happens during a nuclear attack.  She said: 'On top of the initial flash of thermonuclear light, which is 180 million degrees, which catches everything on fire in a nine mile diameter radius; on top of the bulldozing effect of the wind and all the buildings coming down and more fires igniting on top of the radiation poisoning people to death in minutes and hours and days and weeks, if they happen to have survived, on top of all of that, each one of these fires creates a mega fire that is 100 or more square miles and so.'  The author said if the world went into nuclear war you would 'want to die instantly' because 'there is no more law and order.'  She said: 'There's a quote from Nikita Khrushchev, the first secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, he said: '\"After nuclear war the survivors would envy the dead\".  'Who's left? It's man returning to the most primal, most violent state as people fight over the tiny resources that remain, and by the way they're all malnourished, everybody's sick and most people have lost everything and everyone they know. How's that going to feel?'  Elsewhere Annie revealed North Korea has launched more than 100 ballistic missiles in an 18-month period from 2022. Although they were tests she said other nations inform each other when they're going to test so it doesn't cause anxiety and confusion.  She said: 'North Korea doesn't adhere to that. All of that command and control is focused on, \"Is this coming at us?\". North Korea don't announce those tests and so imagine the anxiety in those command bunkers every time they launch a ballistic missile.  'This is so dangerous and so rogue. On one hand I say there are no rules to nuclear war, but there are a few nuclear rules to nuclear deterrence, like you tell neighbours.'  If nuclear war did break out Annie said the safest place to be would be in Australia or New Zealand because of the agricultural resources.  She said: 'Agriculture would fail and when agriculture fails people just die and on top of that you have the radiation poisoning because the ozone layer will be so damaged and destroyed that you can't be outside in the sunlight and so people will be forced to live underground - fighting for food everywhere except in New Zealand and Australia.'",

    "article_text": "The Wall Street Journal, citing American officials, reported that in February 2022, Russia launched a satellite into space designed to test components for a potential anti-satellite weapon capable of carrying a nuclear weapon.  According to the WSJÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s sources, the satellite is a Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cprototypeÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ of the weapon, while other sources are confident that the Russian program to develop anti-satellite weapons has not progressed that far.  The sources say that the prototype satellite, does not carry nuclear weapons, but its launch relates to the ongoing Russian nuclear anti-satellite program.  JOIN US ON TELEGRAM! Follow our coverage of the war on the @Kyivpost_official.  This weapon, if deployed, would allow the Kremlin to destroy hundreds of satellites in low Earth orbit, specifically American satellites, including the Starlink satellite network, which is critical for Ukraine, the report said.  Advertisement  The testing involves the Kosmos-2553 satellite, launched into orbit from the Plesetsk Cosmodrome on Feb. 5, 2022.  Work on the creation of nuclear-powered aircraft began in the USSR in the 1950s. The Soviet military launched satellites containing nuclear power plants into space, one of which fell onto Canadian territory in 1978.  According to other officials interviewed by WSJ, the Kosmos-2553 satellite also secretly functions as a platform for research and development of components of new non-nuclear weapons systems that Russia hopes to deploy in the future.  Russia insisted that the satellite was for only scientific research, but US officials dismissed that claim as implausible.  Other Topics of Interest UN General Assembly Backs Palestinian Bid for Membership The Palestinian push for full UN membership comes seven months into a war between Israel and Palestinian militants Hamas in the Gaza Strip.  The Ministry of Defense of Russia, commenting on the launch of the satellite back in 2022, stated that it was launched in the interests of the Russian military department and that it is equipped with Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201con-board instruments and systems for their processing under the conditions of exposure to radiation and heavy charged particles.Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½  US Assistant Secretary of State Mallory Stewart questioned that explanation in a public statement earlier this month, without naming the specific satellite.  Advertisement  She said the orbiter is in a region not used by any other spacecraft, Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cwhich is somewhat unusual in itself.Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ Stewart added that the orbit is a region with higher radiation levels than normal low-Earth orbits but not high enough to allow accelerated electronics testing, as described by Russia.  She said that the United States has known that Russia has sought to build such a capability for years, but only recently has a more accurate assessment of their progress been made.  The US government in February announced it had obtained intelligence Russia was developing a nuclear device designed to be detonated in space to take hundreds of satellites in low Earth orbit off-line.  Russia used its United Nations Security Council veto on April 25 to vote down an amendment proposing space be kept nuclear-weapons free, with the PeopleÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s Republic of China the only state abstaining.  The other 13 countries serving on the 15-member Security Council were in favor of the resolution calling on all countries, particularly those already space-capable, to commit to preventing the use of nuclear weapons in outer space.  The US was the lead proponent of the measure that, had it been passed, reinforced a 1967 treaty banning the deployment or use of nuclear weapons or weapons of mass destruction from space by any UN member state. Japan was a co-drafter of the resolution.  Advertisement  Russian ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said that Moscow opposed the measure because the amendment to the treaty would ban Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201call weaponsÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ in space, a condition unacceptable to the Kremlin.  US Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield accused Russia of being warlike and unwilling to put the good of humanity ahead of its perceived strategic priorities.  A nuclear explosion in space, by any state, could destroy Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cthousands of satellites operated by countries and companies around the world Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u20acœ and wipe out the vital communications, scientific, meteorological, agricultural, commercial, and national security services we all depend on,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ Thomas-Greenfield said.",

    "article_text": "The wars in Ukraine, the Middle East, and Africa are raging in the context of rising great power competition on the one hand and, on the other, urgent issues that demand global cooperation, such as climate change and the crises in liberal democracies. Attitudes in Europe appear to have hardened significantly since the disastrous Russian invasion of Ukraine. Fearful of an aggressive Russia and believing that there is a need for a stronger European nuclear deterrent, Poland has been testing the waters to see whether it could host US nuclear weapons, and even recently, non-aligned Finland has also been considering nuclear deployments. Responding to the possibility of a new Trump Presidency and doubt over US commitments to Europe, debate has opened up in Germany over building a nuclear force of its own Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u20ac� a move that would irrevocably blow a hole in the global nonproliferation regime.  Looming over all is the shadow of nuclear conflict and talk of a possible Third World War. Confidence in the stability of nuclear deterrence is hitting a new low, yet states appear to be doubling down on their bets. Many statesÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢ leadership profess a shared faith in nuclear deterrence as a contribution to stability (at least when they or their allies control it), but this is probably because they have no idea of any alternative.  There is no question that nuclear threats are so frightening that they can work in dissuading states from aggression (or joining a war). It is said that Russia has been deterred from attacking NATO members or supply lines into Ukraine, and NATO has been deterred from joining the war with boots on the ground or no-fly zones. But the risk is fearsome, and the deterrent effects can wane over time.  It is an obvious but inconvenient truth that nuclear deterrence demands the signalling and credible readiness to fight a nuclear war. The risk of nuclear war is, therefore, baked into nuclear deterrence. As a result, suggestions to reduce nuclear risk, for example, by issuing no-first-use declarations, consistently run up against objections that theyÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢re not practical or undermine the credible threat at the heart of deterrence. Questions about whether or how often nuclear deterrence may fail catastrophically only serve to strengthen deterrence in the minds of advocates.  One additional core problem is often overlooked. Even when nuclear deterrence works, it leaves a residue of poison behind in international relationships, just as a detonated nuclear weapon leaves a trail of invisible radioactive fallout downwind.  The problem is that threats with nuclear weapons are extreme, by their nature, promising massive and devastating harm. It is very difficult to use nuclear weapons without killing civilians and turning large areas into rubble. This triggers something in human nature. Such catastrophic threats cross a line; they create wariness, mistrust, and avoidance in the person being threatened. If your neighbour threatens to kill you and shoot your children and then burn down your house and strangle your dog, you will find it difficult to coexist with, trust, or work cooperatively with that person forever after. Extreme actions and extreme threats make normal relations problematic going forward.  The consequences arising from the use of nuclear weapons are so extreme that the very threat dehumanises those on the receiving end and brutalises those making the threats. President PutinÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s reminders of RussiaÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s nuclear capabilities in early 2022 were a shock, and appear to be the root cause of resentment many in Europe feel towards him, even in the face of his actual destruction in Ukraine. This is despite the fact that analysts find it challenging to articulate what it was about his exact words that departed from past implied nuclear threats supporting aggressive military action (such as UK Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon against non-nuclear Iraq in March 2002).  Nuclear deterrence harms cohesion within the international community. Yet the need for cooperation among the nations of the international community has never been more urgent. Rising hostility and confrontation are all but destroying the international communityÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s capacity to tackle the tremendous common challenges of our time: the weakening fabric of our societies and the rise of populism; responding to climate change; reversing the destruction of our planetÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s ecosystems; and managing weapons of mass destruction and the terrifying destructive possibilities arising from disruptive technologies such as AI. Greater collaboration between governments across many activities is essential for our collective survival. Efforts by many states in the international community to isolate Russia have disrupted negotiations in international fora. One example was the 2022 NPT Review Conference, when there was an attempt to get a consensus agreement that all nuclear power facilities in Ukraine should be under the control of Ukrainians (a demand that Russia would clearly veto).  Although the practice of nuclear deterrence is generally thought of within nuclear-armed states as relatively benign Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u20acœ it carries with it often unnoticed adverse effects, diluting the soft power of those states that practice it. Ward Wilson and Paul Ingram Share  Although the practice of nuclear deterrence is generally thought of within nuclear-armed states as relatively benign Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u20acœ like an invisible shield that protects nations from harm Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u20acœ it carries with it often unnoticed adverse effects, diluting the soft power of those states that practice it. Nuclear-armed states threaten global security and drive arms-racing behaviour and are perenially criticised by other states at every nuclear nonproliferation conference. Evidence that the use of nuclear deterrence may be wearing thin within the majority world is the emergence of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u20ac� which now has more than 80 signatories and has entered into force. States parties to the Treaty are engaged in a host of serious activities aimed at re-evaluating and replacing nuclear deterrence as a defining feature of global politics. The very nature of nuclear deterrence Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u20acœ the credible threat to annihilate the other Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u20acœ exacerbates the current high levels of tension and angry antagonism between the three largest nuclear powers: Russia, the United States, and China.  When nuclear weapons first arrived on the scene, they were hailed by those responsible for US nuclear doctrine as tools that could do virtually anything, but over time, a certain amount of reality has sunk in. Some believe a Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cnuclear tabooÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ has developed, but perhaps the more plausible explanation for their non-use since 1945 is that they are simply too big and too destructive for fighting wars. Our militaries keep hold of them in the belief that within their integrated deterrence strategies (in which nuclear-armed states propose a broad toolbox of capabilities to uphold deterrence), nuclear weapons have an irreplaceable role. But in a world where there are many ways to deliver strategic deterrence across a wide range of effects, ways that are likely to be more credible than the threat of a nuclear attack, it is time to reverse the slide into a new nuclear arms race and instead let go of the dangerous and doubtful belief that nuclear weapons are essential.  Of course, if other tools for effective strategic deterrence are more effective and credible, states could adopt them unilaterally. But this transformation is more likely if they come around to recognising these realities in tandem together. The N5 (formally misnamed P5) Process meeting of nuclear weapon states has continued to meet at the working level and has been discussing nuclear postures. In August, the Chair will be taken on by the Chinese, who rejuvenated the process when they last chaired five years ago. They are set to invite their fellow Nuclear Weapon States to consider the no-first-use doctrine. Still, perhaps they could also kick off a shared process that questions their received wisdom and explores the fundamental utility of nuclear deterrence itself.  The opinions articulated above represent the views of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the position of the European Leadership Network or any of its members. The ELNÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s aim is to encourage debates that will help develop EuropeÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s capacity to address the pressing foreign, defence, and security policy challenges of our time.

    "article_text": "Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cTwo-thirds of South KoreaÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s strategic elites do not favor nuclearization of South Korea,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ Victor Cha, a senior vice president for Asia and Korea Chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said in his latest report published by Washington-based CSIS in April.  The report came out after South Korean domestic polls showed the opposite: that the majority of South Koreans Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u20acœ nearly three-quarters Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u20acœ support the idea of the country developing its own nuclear weapons as a means to deter North KoreaÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s preemptive nuclear strikes. ChaÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s report might come as relief to U.S. elites, as Washington has opposed the idea of South Korea acquiring nuclear weapons for decades, since the end of the 1950-53 Korean War.  Since North Korea demonstrated its abilities to develop advanced nuclear weapons and to conduct nuclear tests, calls have been growing for the South Korean government to develop its own nuclear weapons. Especially in the wake of the collapse of the North Korea-U.S. nuclear talks and the inter-Korean dialogues, South Koreans increasingly support the idea of the country having nuclear weapons as a security guarantee.  Traditionally, Washington elites and policymakers have had deep-seated objections to this idea. However, one of the figures who may influence a future Trump administrationÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s policy on North Korea (if former President Donald Trump is re-elected in November) offered an iconoclastic perspective in an exclusive interview with South KoreaÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s Yonhap News Agency.  Elbridge A. Colby, former deputy assistant secretary of defense for strategy and force development, said it is unrealistic to expect North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to give up his nuclear weapons, meaning the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is an unrealistic goal.  It is not a comforting remark for those in Seoul who still believe that the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula can happen, depending on the willingness of the U.S. to resolve the security conflicts on the peninsula.  Instead, Colby argued that U.S. policy on North Korea should be centered on arms control to limit the range of North KoreaÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s intercontinental ballistic missiles Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u20acœ which are believed to be able to target the mainland of the United States. That, too, will arouse concern in Seoul, as it would leave the North in possession of thousands of nuclear capable, shorter-range missiles that could decimate South Korea.  Colby also stressed the necessity of shifting the focus of the U.S. forces stationed in South Korea from North Korea to China.  In the interview, Colby clearly emphasized that he is not part of TrumpÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s campaign team so as to prevent readers from misreading his comments as the official stance of Trump on North Korea. Even so, his remarks should be noted.  The latest poll by the New York Times on May 13 showed Trump in the lead in five key battleground states: Pennsylvania, Arizona, Michigan, Georgia and Nevada. This means that TrumpÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s victory in the upcoming U.S. presidential election must be considered a serious possibility (even as he appears in trials as the first U.S. president to be prosecuted in history).  If Trump assumes the presidency again, dramatic changes in the United StatesÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢ policy on North Korea might follow, considering his latest remarks that Seoul should pay more for the presence of U.S. forces in South Korea.  For those who support the South developing nuclear weapons, such views from Trump and a former defense official in his administration will bolster the case that Seoul should pursue nuclear weapons for its own defense. However, the consequences of such a decision would be extreme.  To start, such an action will destabilize the Korean Peninsula even further, providing a justifiable excuse for Pyongyang to further boost its nuclear and missile development. Seoul would also face ChinaÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s reaction to its nuclear development, further increasing the pressure on South Korean security.  Also, if South Korea officially takes steps to develop indigenous nuclear weapons (rather than persuading the United States to redeploy its nuclear weapons on the SouthÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s soil), it would damage the South Korea-U.S. alliance. Seoul would lose its status as one of the United StatesÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢ key allies in Asia. Not only that, but Seoul would be isolated from the larger international community. South Korea could expect to be sanctioned by the United States and the United Nations for its violation of the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).  No matter how and when South Korea can actually produce nuclear weapons, merely making the attempt will cost Seoul its leverage and power in the international community. Its years-long demands for North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons to build a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula would no longer be compelling. South Korea losing its position as a middle-power country whose voice can influence international agendas through its growing soft power is a nightmare scenario.  For Seoul, the costs clearly outweigh the advantages of developing nuclear weapons. With a strengthed South Korea-U.S. alliance and a powerful conventional military, Seoul already has a strong deterrent toward North Korean nuclear attacks.  South Korea has the power to diplomatically resolve security conflicts with North Korea. Rather than pursuing the easiest path for its defense, Seoul should consistently work with neighboring countries to pressure North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons so that the Koreas can construct a permanent peace on the Korean Peninsula for future generations.",

    "article_text": "The USS Harry S. Truman, a nuclear-power aircraft carrier, is pictured off the coast of Miami on Sunday, May 5, 2024. The ship was visiting MiamiÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s Fleet Week during its ongoing train up to prepare it to deploy to the Red Sea later this year. (Corey Dickstein/Stars and Stripes)  MIAMI Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u20ac� The USS Harry S. Truman will soon lead a Navy strike group into the volatile Red Sea, where U.S. sailors have fought almost daily for months to down drones and missiles launched by Houthi rebels from Yemen.  The nuclear-powered aircraft carrier and its 6,000-some sailors have spent recent months training in the western Atlantic Ocean for that mission Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u20ac� a rare, pre-planned deployment expected to take the ship into a hostile environment. In recent weeks, its sailors have been undergoing flight deck testing, its pilots knowing that later this year they will be tasked with shooting down drones and munitions launched by the Iran-backed Houthis.  Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cThey know that theyÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢re most likely going to be entering a weapon engagement zone,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ said Adm. Daryl Caudle, the leader of U.S. Navy Fleet Forces Command. Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cI believe, personally, that puts higher stakes on why what we do [in training] is so important. Ã¢â\u201a¬Â¦ For this group, this [deployment] is not with the mindset that theyÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢re just going to go drill holes in the water somewhere Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u20ac� this is, Ã¢â\u201a¬ËœWeÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢re going to be employed for combat.Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢ Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½  But with combat on the minds of the TrumanÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s sailors and preparations being made to deploy to the hostile waters of the Red Sea, the 1,000-foot-long, 104,000-ton aircraft carrier made a rare appearance in Miami to have the shipÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s sailors participate recently in the cityÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s first Fleet Week.  Sailors aboard the USS Bataan, an amphibious assault ship, look out at the USS Truman aircraft carrier as the Bataan pulls into the port of Miami for Fleet Week on Sunday, May 5, 2024. (Corey Dickstein/Stars and Stripes)  There was some Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cpushbackÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ from Navy planners, Caudle admitted. An aircraft carrier had never participated in a U.S. Fleet Week anywhere. But when Fleet Week kicked off May 5, the Truman sat stoic, anchored just a few miles off the coast of Miami Beach Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u20ac� its sailors gathered on the flight deck to wave emphatically at their counterparts aboard the USS Bataan, as the amphibious assault ship entered MiamiÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s port.  Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cI will admit that bringing a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier to a Fleet Week is unique,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ said Caudle, who is charged with providing trained and ready naval forces to combatant commanders around the world. Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cAnd of course ... theyÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢re [in the middle of] doing the training Ã¢â\u201a¬Â¦ they need to do to ensure that theyÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢re certified and qualified and proficient and ready to go fight. Fleet Week is not built into that.Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½  The crew used the voyage from its home base in Norfolk, Va., to Miami and back Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u20ac� the Truman returned Friday to Norfolk Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u20ac� to conduct extra tactical training at sea, Caudle said. The carrierÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s time in Miami was largely meant to give sailors a fun port call and to interact with the local community, a sort-of recruiting effort that top Navy officials, including Caudle, said they hoped would spark interest in the sea service among more young Miamians.  The admiral said he hoped the Fleet Week stop, wedged into a critical train-up for what would likely be the most dangerous deployment most of the sailors have ever served, would spark memories of their service and bolster their quality of life in the Navy.  Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cOnce they actually come over to the city, and immerse themselves into this incredible town, and get to experience the food, and the people, and the nightlife and all that, that is what builds the memories, and [that is] why people stay in the Navy,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ Caudle said. Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cIÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢m going to be honest; this is what I remember from my almost 40-year career are the places IÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢ve pulled into. The operations tend to be a bit of a blur, but you really remember the port calls.Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½  With Fleet Week over, the bulk of the TrumanÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s preparations begin.  Navy officials declined to say precisely when the Truman will embark on its cross-Atlantic voyage toward the Red Sea to replace the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower, which deployed from Norfolk in October. Caudle said the deployment was still Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cseveral months out.Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ The Eisenhower briefly left the Red Sea last month for the Mediterranean Sea, but it has recently returned to the Red Sea, according to the Navy.  Naval Air Crewman 2nd Class Matthew Watkins, a native of Anthem, Ariz., attached to the Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cDragonslayersÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ of Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron 11, sits in an MH-60S Sea Hawk helicopter as it prepares to launch from the flight deck of the Nimitz-class aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman on April 25, 2024, in the Atlantic Ocean. (Michael Shen/U.S. Navy)  The Navy canceled a planned visit to the Truman for news reporters during the Miami Fleet Week, and the shipÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s top leaders were not made available for interviews.  Caudle said he was confident in the shipÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s ongoing preparations. The Navy was already incorporating Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201clessons learnedÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ in the Truman crewÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s training from the Eisenhower strike groupÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s fighting with the Houthis.  While the admiral declined to provide specifics about most of those new lessons, he said they are informing the scenarios that the Truman has faced in its training. Ultimately, as the carrier completes its pre-deployment training, the ship will deal with similar issues that the Eisenhower and its escort ships have faced in the Red Sea, Caudle said. Those include lessons on some strategies such as where a strike groupÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s ships should be in relation to one another, how its radar systems should be tuned and the decision-making processes on which weapon should be employed against which incoming munition and when, he said.  Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cWeÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢re taking all these lessons from [the Eisenhower] strike group in real time Ã¢â\u201a¬Â¦ and bringing all those lessons weÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢ve learned to bear in the scenarios that we use against Truman to make sure that is the most relevant set that we can build for them,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ Caudle said.  The Eisenhower and her strike group have faced nearly six months of fighting in the Red Sea. While the groupÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s destroyers have been credited with taking down many of the drones and missiles fired by Houthi rebels into crowded shipping lanes, the EisenhowerÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s aircraft have flown near constant missions in the area, Navy officials have said. The carrierÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s fighter planes have shot down drones and missiles and launched so-called Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cdynamic strikes,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ often to take out ballistic missiles that appear ready for launch, Pentagon officials have said in recent months.  Truman will bring some 90 aircraft, including F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jets, E-2D Hawkeye command and control aircraft, E/A18 Growler electronic warfare jets, and MH-60 Seahawk helicopters.  It will likely enter conditions that another top admiral described this week as the most volatile that Navy sailors on deployed ships have faced since World War II.  Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cThey have to be prepared on a momentÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s notice to conduct engagements,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ Rear Adm. Fred Pyle, the serviceÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s surface warfare director, said Tuesday at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank in Washington. Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cAnd they have to get it right every single time.Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½  Sailors conduct flight operations on the flight deck of the Nimitz-class aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman on April 24, 2024, in the Atlantic Ocean. (Matthew Nass/U.S. Navy)  Pyle and Caudle said they have been impressed with the Eisenhower strike groupÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s successes in the Red Sea, where the ships are leading a coalition of some 24 nations supporting Operation Prosperity Guardian, the international mission to thwart the Houthi attacks. The rebel group, which receives its arms and other support from Iran, has claimed the attacks are in response to IsraelÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s ongoing war against Hamas in Gaza, which was launched after the surprise attack by Hamas militants on Israeli civilians in October.  U.S. Central Command, which oversees American military operations in the Middle East including the Red Sea, has sent out near daily readouts of engagements between coalition Navy personnel and the Houthis. Pyle said the operations successes have bolstered confidence in the systems that the service has invested in to protect sailors aboard its ships.  Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cThe threats theyÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢re engaging [in the Red Sea] are unmanned, theyÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢re anti-ship cruise missiles, theyÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢re anti-ship ballistic missiles, and in each one of those threat groups weÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢re performing well,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ Pyle said. Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cAnd the systems and the sailors are performing as designed and great.Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½  Caudle said he expected the Truman strike group would seamlessly pick up the mission and perform just as well as the Eisenhower group has to date. Talking to the shipÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s sailors, the admiral said, he can sense they are ready to get in the fight.  Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cI think people join a combat service, you know, to be part of a combat team,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ Caudle said. Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cThey want to go and actually exercise that and do what they do for a living and Ã¢â\u201a¬Â¦ be stressed to the ultimate limit out there.  Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cIn the Red Sea right now, weÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢re bringing the full complement of naval combat power to bear. ... But we want to deter conflict. That is the main effort. There is nothing that does that more than 100,000 tons of diplomacy in an aircraft carrier.Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½",

Some $300bn (Ã\u201aÂ£237bn) worth of financial assets were frozen by the G7 after Moscow invaded Ukraine in February 2022.  Earlier this month, EU nations agreed a deal in principle to provide Kyiv with additional funds for military supplies using Russian asset profits.

    "article_text": "Another Islamic Republic figure has amplified recent rhetoric by top officials about IranÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s nuclear weapons capabilities, this time also emphasizing Tehran's long range missile technologies.  \"If a nation possesses superior air power and poses a threat to us, we will reciprocate with a corresponding threat,\" Fereydoun Abbasi declared. \"Our adversaries are well aware of our capability to launch satellites. This proficiency underscores the high standards of a nation capable of placing satellites into specific orbits.\"  Abbasi was the previous head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organization and is currently a member of parliament and known as a hardliner figure among Iranian politicians.  Abbasi added that Iran does not believe in weapons of mass destruction, but cannot allow those who have weapons to \"misuse their power.\"  In January this year, following IranÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s announcement of the launch of the Soraya satellite using the Ghaem-100 Space Launch Vehicle (SLV), the UK, France, and Germany (the E3) issued a joint statement condemning the launch due to the SLV using Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201c technology essential for the development of a long-range ballistic missile system.Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½  The three countries are among the original signatories of the 2015 JCPOA nuclear deal with Iran.  Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cWe have longstanding concerns over IranÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s activity related to ballistic missile technologies that are capable of delivering nuclear weapons. These concerns are reinforced by IranÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s continued nuclear escalation beyond all credible civilian justification,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ the E3 statement further emphasized.  Moreover, Abbasi who was sanctioned in 2007 for being Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cinvolved in IranÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s nuclear or ballistic missile activities,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ also criticized International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA) chief Rafael Grossi in light of his recent visit to Iran.  \"Grossi is not an independent person and is influenced by several Western countries including America. America's views are dictated to the agency and nothing has changed in this regard.\"  He urged that Iran must Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cadvance nuclear measures and act with strengthÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ and taking such an approach will give Iran Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cthe upper hand in negotiationsÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½.  Meanwhile, following his recent trip to Iran, Grossi expressed deep concern on Tuesday in an interview with the Guardian regarding recent remarks from Iranian officials indicating a potential pursuit of nuclear weapons and their apparent lack of cooperation with UN inspectors.  Grossi's remarks came in the wake of statements made by IranÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s Supreme LeaderÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s foreign policy advisor, Kamal Kharrazi, last week. Kharrazi had stated, that if Israel attacked Iran's nuclear sites, Iran would consider a doctrinal shift to nuclear deterrence.  Despite GrossiÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s concerns, Abbasi further echoed a similar sentiment about IranÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s changing nuclear doctrine emphasizing that it is not set in stone but rather adapts to existing circumstances.  Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cWe may go to nuclear proliferation once, then for some reason, we may go to hybrid nuclear power. As soon as we change our policies in the field of radiation, energy production, and fuel production, it sends a message to the West,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ Abbasi added.  Such statements made by senior Iranian officials, intensify concerns over IranÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s nuclear policy, raising the question of how close is Iran to building a nuclear bomb.  US-based advocacy group, United Against Nuclear Iran (UANI), highlights the three essential components for building a nuclear weapon: enriched fissile material, a delivery vehicle, and a warhead.  According to the former head of Iran's nuclear agency, Ali-Akbar Salehi statement in February, it appears that Iran has the technology for all the components it needs for a nuclear bomb.  Moreover, experts caution that Iran's expertise in developing missile delivery systems poses additional concerns.  The escalating rhetoric from high-ranking Iranian officials regarding nuclear capabilities, coupled with concerns expressed by international bodies and experts, underscores the gravity of the situation. As tensions between Iran and Israel continue to simmer, the possibility of Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons raises significant global security concerns.",

    "article_text": "For one, if Russia believed the U.K. had launched a nuclear attack on its cities, it would be highly likely to retaliate by launching a similar attack on the U.K. Also, the very act of a Vanguard submarine launching a Trident missile would risk revealing its location Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u20ac� information that could give RussiaÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s forces the opportunity to destroy it. And since the U.K. would likely have only one nuclear-armed submarine at sea, it could end up sacrificing its ability to respond to or deter a nuclear attack on its own shores.  So, whatever the U.K.Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s official policy says, itÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s close to inconceivable that Britain would use its nuclear weapons in case of an attack on a NATO ally rather than one on the U.K. itself. The Trident nuclear missiles may be an effective deterrent to nuclear strikes on the U.K., but they offer precious little protection to its allies.  France, meanwhile, has more nuclear weapons than the U.K., with most of its warheads deployed in its Le Triomphant-class submarines, and others on carrier or land-based aircraft. However, France has never Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cdeclaredÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ or Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cassignedÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ its nuclear weapons to NATO. French nuclear weapons are there to defend France alone, and until recently, French governments never pretended otherwise.  To really understand what Macron was getting at in his Sorbonne speech, though, we must recall his ElysÃƒÂ©e speech from 2020, where he mentioned the use of French nuclear weapons. In that statement, Macron implied France might use them to defend European allies. He said nuclear deterrence was a last-resort guardian of the countryÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s vital interests, but he also added that these interests now had a European dimension.  Cutting through the somewhat Delphic style of these speeches, Macron seems to have suggested a carbon-copy of the U.K. policy. He is right, of course, to Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201csmell the coffeeÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ as regards the risks to European defense that would result from U.S. disengagement. One risk would be that Russia could dominate nonnuclear armed European allies with the threat or use of tactical nuclear weapons in any conflict.  Current Russian doctrine holds that lower-yield tactical (or battlefield) nuclear weapons are Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201ca controllable means of achieving battlefield results and an end to hostilities.Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ According to recently leaked Russian documents, even the loss of conventional military assets, such as airfields, in a conflict could trigger a tactical nuclear response by Russia. And just a couple weeks ago, the Kremlin announced tactical nuclear weapons exercises to improve their readiness for combat.",

The depot stored most of the bombs and missiles for Su-27, Su-30, and MiG-31 fighter-bombers that have been attacking Ukrainian cities and infrastructure. The secondary explosions caused further destruction across the airfield.  According to the Russian Defense Ministry, in the pre-dawn hours of May 16, drones and missiles were intercepted over four Russian regions, with additional attacks targeting Crimea.  Advertisement  In the Belgorod region, the governor reported that two people were injured when multiple rocket launchers reportedly shelled the city of Shebekino. The attack damaged eight private homes and several cars.  The governor of Sevastopol in the occupied Crimea stated that fragments from a downed missile damaged private houses and a car, while an explosive wave shattered six windows. No casualties were reported.  Further drone interceptions occurred over the Tula, Bryansk, and Kaluga regions, with no reported injuries or damage.  One day before this attack, in the early hours of Wednesday, May 15, powerful explosions hit Belbek airfield in Crimea and set fires burning for hours, in long-range strikes the Kremlin said were American ATACMS missiles fired by Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) gunners.

Local social media followed by regional officials reported more than twenty explosions of varying intensity audible in the vicinity of Belbek airfield beginning shortly before 2 a.m. Moscow time and lasting about ten minutes.  Russian officials in the occupation authority in the Kremlin-occupied Crimea in early statements said Ukrainian forces had launched long-range missiles at Belbek airfield but all the Ukrainian weapons were shot down.  Advertisement  Later official announcements, among them by the Moscow-appointed Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cmayorÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ of Sevastopol Mikhail Razvozhaev, said US-manufactured ATACMS missiles had been used in the alleged failed strikes.  The Russian officials claimed Russian air defenses intercepted all the ATACMS, but some of the US-made precision-guided weapons had dispersed cluster munitions, prompting the authorities to warn the public not to touch them.

    "article_text": "A smoke plume rises over the southern Lebanon village of Kfar Kila during Israeli bombardment on May 16, 2024, amid ongoing cross-border clashes between Israeli troops and Hezbollah fighters. (Rabih Daher, AFP via Getty Images/TNS)  (Tribune News Service) Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u20ac� Hezbollah said it launched Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cmore than 60 rocketsÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ at Israeli military sites on Thursday in response to an attack that killed one of its senior commanders.  The Iran-backed militant group targeted air-defense and artillery facilities in the Israeli-occupied area of the Golan Heights, HezbollahÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s Al-Manar TV reported.  IsraelÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s military said it detected about 40 missiles launched from Lebanon and intercepted several of them. There were no injuries reported, it said, adding that its fighter jets struck one of the military posts from which the rockets came.  ItÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s the second straight day that Hezbollah has retaliated against the Israel Defense Forces for the killing a field commander called Hussain Ibrahim Mekky on Tuesday night. Hezbollah described it as an assassination and fired Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cheavy BurkanÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ missiles at Israeli military facilities on Wednesday.  Israel and Hezbollah have been exchanging fire almost every day since the Israel-Hamas war broke out in October.  The latest clashes mark some of the most forceful strikes by Hezbollah and are likely to fuel concerns that the skirmishes could escalate into a full-blown conflict and open up a new war front for Israel.  The U.S., France and others powers are trying to broker a diplomatic deal that would see Hezbollah fighters retreat from the Lebanese border area near Israel. Israeli officials say thatÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s necessary to ensure around 100,000 people evacuated from northern towns can return home.  The Hezbollah-Israel exchanges have mostly been kept within what each side defines as the implicit rules of engagement Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u20ac� civilians arenÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢t directly targeted and the areas of attack are close to the Israel-Lebanon border. But exceptions to those rules are becoming more frequent.  Hezbollah, designated a terrorist group by the U.S., is the most powerful militia in the Middle East and thought by Israeli intelligence to have more than 100,000 rockets and missiles, a much bigger arsenal than what Hamas had before October.  Israel has been targeted by thousands of Hezbollah missiles, drones and artillery shells since Oct. 7 Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u20ac� the date Hamas militants invaded the country. The attacks from Lebanon have killed around 25 Israelis, including soldiers. Roughly 350 people have been killed by Israeli strikes on Lebanon, most of them Hezbollah fighters.

    "article_text": "La Russia launched a research spacecraft into orbit two years ago as part of a project to develop an anti-satellite nuclear weapon. An anonymous US government official reported this to the \"Wall Street Journal\" newspaper, providing new rumors regarding the alleged Russian weapons system that became the subject of speculation in Western media earlier this year. According to the official quoted by the \"Wall Street Journal\", on February 5, 2022, Russia launched an experimental satellite, Cosmos-2533, into orbit precisely to conduct research on the new weapon system, which according to some rumors was conceived to destroy hundreds of low-orbiting satellites via nuclear explosion.      Cosmos-2533 - specifies the source cited by the newspaper - is not equipped with nuclear weapons, but is still in space, along \"an unusual orbit\" around the Earth, and has been secretly used by Moscow in the last two years as \" research and development platform for the non-nuclear components of the new weapon system, which Russia has not yet deployedÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½. Russia Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u20acœ specifies the Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cWall Street JournalÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u20acœ has never made a secret of the launch of the satellite, which he classified as an ordinary satellite for scientific research.  The alleged Russian anti-satellite weapons program was made public last February by the Republican congressman from Ohio, Mike Turner, president of the Intelligence Committee of the US House of Representatives, who had mentioned the existence of an unspecified \" serious threat to the national securityÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ of the United States, and had urged President Joe Biden's administration to make its nature known. The White House subsequently confirmed the existence of a Russian program to develop \"worrying\" anti-satellite capabilities. US federal government officials had called the threat \"serious\", but not immediate.

    "description": "The Romanian Air Force is to equip its F-16s with the AIM-9X Block II air-to-air missile. (Romanian Air Force) The United States has approved the sale of 300 RTX AIM-9X Block II Sidewinder short-range air-to-air missiles to Romania, announcing a potential USD340.8 million sale on 14 May. The US Department of State approval covers the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) of the missiles for the Romanian Air Force (RoAF) fleet of Lockheed Martin F-16AM/BM Block 15 Mid-Life Update (MLU) combat aircraft, as well as training missiles, related equipment, training, and support. Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cThe proposed sale will improve Romania's capability to meet current and future threats by providing air-to-air missiles for its F-16 fleet in support of NATO's defence mission,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ the US Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) said. The RoAF is in the early stages of standing up 49 F-16 aircraft, the first 17 of which it has been receiving from Portugal from 2013, with another 32 to follow from Norway. Upgraded to the M6.X standard, all of Romania's jets will employ the AIM-9X Block II, as well as the RTX AIM-120D/C-7 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM), the Boeing GBU-39 Small Diameter Bomb (SDB), and the Boeing Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM). They will also feature updates to the AN/ALR-56 radar warning receiver (RWR), GPS software, AN/AAQ-14 LANTIRN targeting pod, and Link-16 tactical datalink. Romania is also considering the F-16V (designated F-16C/D Block 70/72 in its newbuild configuration) upgrade package and has formalised its intention to purchase the Lockheed Martin F-35A Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter (JSF).

    "article_text": "The head of the International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, has expressed profound concerns regarding recent statements from Iranian officials hinting at the potential development of nuclear weapons and the countryÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s persistent lack of cooperation with United Nations inspectors. GrossiÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s comments followed a meeting with British Foreign Secretary David Cameron, highlighting the escalating tensions surrounding IranÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s nuclear activities.  Speaking to the UKÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s Guardian newspaper, Grossi emphasized the severity of the situation, stating, Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cLoose talk about nuclear weapons is extremely serious for me. And I think it should stop. We are moving closer to a situation where there is a big, huge question mark about what they are doing and why they are doing it.Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ His remarks underscore the growing unease within the international community about IranÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s nuclear intentions and the implications for global security.  The status of the agreement with Iran concerning the inspection of its civil nuclear program appears increasingly precarious. On May 8, Kamal Kharrazi, an adviser to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, was quoted by IranÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s Student News Network as saying, Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cWe have no decision to build a nuclear bomb, but should IranÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s existence be threatened, there will be no choice but to change our military doctrine.Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ This statement, coupled with reports that Khamenei has called for the expulsion of UN weapons inspectors, exacerbates fears of IranÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s potential shift towards a nuclear weapons program.  Historically, Tehran has maintained that its nuclear program is intended solely for peaceful purposesÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u20ac�a claim met with skepticism by Israel and much of the Western world. Grossi, however, is not seeking a new agreement to replace the one signed with Iran in March 2023. Instead, he aims to clarify the scope of what inspectors are permitted to observe before the IAEA board of governors convenes again in June.  Following his recent visits to Tehran and Isfahan, Grossi expressed frustration over IranÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201ccompletely unsatisfactoryÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ cooperation. He lamented the lack of access to critical information, noting, Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cThere was a period when we were recording information and storing this information but could not access it. But there is another period in which there was nothing. Without us being able to see more in Iran, my ability to guarantee that everything is for peaceful uses in Iran would be limited and perhaps approaching the moment where I would not be able to say that anymore.Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½  Grossi warned that there would come a point when he would Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cdraw the lineÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ with Iran, marking a critical juncture for the international community. He cautioned that without transparency, the world would be left in the dark about IranÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s nuclear capabilities, forcing countries to make their own conclusions.  In February, Grossi reported that Iran continued to enrich uranium to 60 percent purityÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u20ac�a level far exceeding commercial nuclear needs and alarmingly close to weapons-grade 90 percent. This development follows IranÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s suspension of compliance with the 2015 nuclear deal after the United States, under former President Donald Trump, unilaterally withdrew from the agreement in 2018 and reimposed stringent sanctions.  Since the agreementÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s collapse, tensions between Iran and the IAEA have intensified, with European Union-mediated efforts failing to reintegrate Washington into the accord or persuade Tehran to adhere to its terms. The IAEA has repeatedly criticized Iran for its lack of cooperation, citing issues such as the expansion of its nuclear activities, the barring of inspectors, and the deactivation of monitoring devices at its facilities.  In its most recent report presented at the board of governors meeting in March, the IAEA revealed that IranÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s estimated stockpile of enriched uranium had reached 27 times the limit established by the 2015 accord. This alarming escalation highlights the urgent need for international attention and action.  Warning to the International Community  The continuing appeasement of the Iranian regime by the international community and world powers carries significant risks. Failure to address IranÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s nuclear ambitions with firm and decisive action could lead to severe consequences, including the potential proliferation of nuclear weapons and heightened regional instability. It is imperative that global leaders unite to enforce stringent measures and ensure IranÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s compliance with international nuclear agreements to safeguard global peace and security.",

    "article_text": "The U.S. military has warned that China is moving forward with development of floating nuclear reactors in the South China Sea to bolster its claim to disputed maritime territory. Analysts say the plan to build ships with mobile nuclear power sources would raise tensions with its neighbors and pose risks to the environment.  Chinese media reports described the marine nuclear power platforms as small plants inside ships that would act as mobile Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cpower banks\" at sea for stationary facilities and other ships. Beijing had suspended the project a year ago over safety and effectiveness concerns, reported the South China Morning Post.  But the outgoing commander of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command and State Department officials this month said China is still building the floating reactors to supply power to disputed islands, the Washington Post reported.  Although U.S. officials told the Post the deployment of such reactors would take several years, Admiral John Aquilino said their development would undermine regional security and stability.  The Philippines last week echoed those concerns.  Philippines National Security Council Assistant Director General Jonathan Malaya said China would use its floating reactors to power military bases it has built on artificial islands, including those within the PhilippinesÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢ exclusive economic zone. He told local media that ChinaÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s nuclear plants would further militarize disputed areas of the South China Sea.  Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cAnything that supports their military presence in those islands is technically a threat to our national security and against our interests,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ he said, adding that Australia and the U.S. would be among ManilaÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s allies conducting joint patrols in the South China Sea.  Beijing claims control over almost the entire South China Sea, putting it in dispute with Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam. China has already built artificial islands with airport runways to strengthen its claims.  Analysts say BeijingÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s floating reactors would not only strengthen its military presence in the area but also give them an excuse to extend its reach through security actions.  Song Yanhui, director of the International Law Society of the Republic of China, Taiwan, told VOA the current military security zone for China's artificial islands is a radius of 500 meters (1,640 feet), meaning other aircraft and ships that enter this radius can be legitimately expelled.  Song said that if China deploys a floating nuclear power plant in the South China Sea, it could use the excuse of protecting the environment from radioactive pollution to drive away ships from a larger area or to take defensive measures.  For Beijing, he said, \"It kills two birds with one stone. It is a win-win strategy. It can strengthen its military presence, civilian use and claim to sovereignty.\"  But the potential for radiation leaks is a real concern, say analysts.  Pankaj Jha, dean of research at the School of International Affairs of IndiaÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s Jindal Global University, told VOA ChinaÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s lack of experience in operating such floating reactors could spell disaster.  \"It is a threat because it will contaminate water and also surrounding areas,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ he said. Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cAny radiation leak would make the island uninhabitable and might also impact fishermen from the South China Sea.\"  Analysts note in the event of conflict with China, the floating reactors could also become military targets.  China has deployed radars, anti-ship and anti-aircraft missiles, and fighter jets, among other weapons, on the disputed territories of Mischief Reef, Subi Reef and Fiery Cross, the three largest artificial islands in the Spratly Islands.  Richard Fisher, senior fellow with the International Assessment and Strategy Center, told VOA floating nuclear power plants could also one day extend ChinaÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s weapons capabilities.  \"If they were protected, these nuclear power plants could also potentially power future energy weapon devices,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ Fisher said. Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cLaser weapons that could knock down missiles and aircraft or very powerful microwave weapons could also disable missiles and aircraft that would get within their range.\"  Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, would not comment on the concerns expressed about ChinaÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s plans to move forward with the floating nuclear power plants.  Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cI am not aware of the particular case you have shared with us, thus could only reply in principle,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ he told VOA in an emailed response May 14. Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cChinaÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s position on the South China Sea issue is clear and consistent. We will stay committed to properly handling disputes through dialogue and consultation with countries concerned, and would like to work with ASEAN [Association of Southeast Asian Nation] countries to fully and effectively implement the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea, advance the consultation on a code of conduct in the South China Sea and jointly safeguard peace and stability in the region.\"  China is not the first country to look at building floating nuclear reactors.  The United States took the lead in proposing the concept as early as 1970 but due to safety concerns did not quickly pursue development.  Russia is the only country that has brought a floating nuclear power plant to fruition, with the Akademik Lomonosov plant producing electricity and heating since 2020 from a harbor in Pevek, a town in the Arctic Circle.  The International Atomic Energy Agency at a November forum in Vienna expressed concern about the development of floating nuclear reactors, particularly when they cross international borders or operate in international waters.  Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cThe IAEA is working with our member states to determine what further guidance and standards might be needed to ensure the safety of floating nuclear power plants,\" IAEA Deputy Director General Lydie Evrard said in a press release.  The IAEA noted Canada, China, Denmark, South Korea, Russia and the U.S. are each working on marine-based Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201csmall modular reactor designs.Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½",

    "article_text": "As tensions escalate between Russia and Western powers, President Putin orders tactical nuclear drills, citing threats from France, Britain, and the US. The Southern Military District, near Ukraine, will host exercises involving missile forces, aviation, and the navy. Experts speculate on the significance of linking such drills to ongoing conflicts and the potential deployment of various weapons systems. Analysts interpret PutinÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s actions as nuclear signalling, raising concerns about the conflictÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s escalation and the role of tactical nuclear weapons.  Sign up for your early morning brew of the BizNews Insider to keep you up to speed with the content that matters. The newsletter will land in your inbox at 5:30am weekdays. Register here.  By Guy Faulconbridge, Mark Trevelyan  Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered his military to practise the deployment of tactical nuclear weapons after what Moscow said were threats from France, Britain and the United States. ___STEADY_PAYWALL___  Why, and what will happen?  WHAT DRILLS WILL TAKE PLACE AND WHERE?  RussiaÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s defence ministry said missile forces in the Southern Military District will take part, together with aviation and the navy. The southern district, headquartered in Rostov-on-Don, lies alongside Ukraine and includes parts of Ukraine which Russia controls. Belarus will also be involved. The Russian Foreign Ministry linked the drills to what it called Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cmilitant statementsÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ by Western officials which it said created security threats for Russia. It specifically mentioned French President Emmanuel Macron, British Foreign Secretary David Cameron and the delivery to Ukraine of U.S. Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS).  Macron has floated the idea of sending European troops to fight Russia in Ukraine while Cameron said that Ukraine had a right to use the weapons provided by London to strike targets inside Russia.  WHY IS THIS SIGNIFICANT?  All nuclear powers carry out routine nuclear exercises but it is extremely rare to explicitly link such drills in public to a current war as Russia did. It is unclear how much Russia will allow the outside world to see.  WHAT WILL HAPPEN?  Mock warheads will probably be taken out of storage and driven to a designated point where soldiers will train how to Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cmateÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ them with the aircraft or missiles that would be used to deliver them.  Russia has numerous weapons systems capable of delivering a tactical nuclear warhead Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u20acœ meaning one designed for use on the battlefield, as opposed to strategic warheads that could wipe out whole cities.  The U.S. and its allies will be watching closely which ones are involved. They could include Iskander, Kinzhal, Kalibr or Novator 9M729 missiles, and possibly air-dropped bombs, said William Alberque of the International Institute for Strategic Studies. Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cThe Kalibr Kh-102 is of great interest because the Kh-101 has been so comparatively easy for Ukraine to shoot down,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ said Alberque, who believes the war in Ukraine has increased the importance to Moscow of tactical nuclear weapons as a means of deterring and defeating NATO.  WHAT IS PUTIN SAYING?  Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cThis is a clear case of nuclear signalling,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ said Matt Korda, senior research fellow for the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists.  Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cRussiaÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s nuclear signalling in the context of its invasion of Ukraine has been designed to deter conventional invasion by NATO and long-range strikes into Russia.Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½  Pavel Podvig, director of the Russian Nuclear Forces Project, said: Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cThis is supposed to be a signal to the West, probably to make people stop thinking about deeper involvement in the war. But I believe we can be quite confident that it is not a threat to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine or against Ukraine.Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½  Nikolai Sokov, a former Soviet and Russian arms control official, said the message was intended for NATO, Europe and particularly France.  Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cThey (Russia) felt it necessary to invoke nuclear weapons as a signal that the move, about which Macron has been talking, may result in escalation up to the nuclear threshold,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ said Sokov, a senior fellow at the Vienna Center for Disarmament and Non-Proliferation.  He said Russia had sent a previous signal when it announced the deployment of tactical nuclear missiles to Belarus last year, but this was Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201call but ignoredÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ by the West.  WILL RUSSIA USE NUCLEAR WEAPONS?  A senior Russian source who spoke on condition of anonymity said the signal was meant to make the West afraid and to deter the United States and its European allies from a potentially catastrophic escalation over Ukraine.  The source said that the WestÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s declared aim of defeating Russia on the battlefield could trigger a nuclear scenario.  Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cYou are making a grave mistake if you dismiss such signals,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ the source said. Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cRussia will not be defeated.Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½  ChristopherÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u20ac¹Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u20ac¹Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u20ac¹Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u20ac¹ Chivvis, Senior Fellow and Director of the American Statecraft Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said: Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cPutin is reminding the world that Russia is a nuclear power and indicating that he might be willing to use nuclear weapons in the war in Ukraine.  Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cHe is not saying that he is about to do so, but warning that there are some conditions under which he would do so,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ said Chivvis, a former U.S. intelligence official.  Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cIt seems unlikely Russia would use such weapons offensively to make gains on the battlefield. More likely, they would use them defensively in a situation where Russian forces were rapidly retreating and significant losses seemed probable.Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½  Read also:  SOURCE: REUTERS  (Reporting by Guy Faulconbridge in Moscow and Mark Trevelyan in London; Editing by Nick Macfie)  Visited 12 times, 12 visit(s) today",

    "article_text": "Rep. Teresa Leger FernÃƒÂ¡ndez (D-N.M.) admits she doesnÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢t have a lot in common politically with Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.). But, she says, sometimes that doesnÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢t matter.  Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cOur communities share a common bond of the injustice and harms caused by nuclear testing,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ Leger FernÃƒÂ¡ndez told HuffPost Wednesday. Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cThat common bond means we share a common purpose in this legislation.Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½  The legislation in question would extend a program to compensate victims of WWII- and Cold War-era U.S. nuclear weapons production and testing, and expand the programÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s scope to include previously excluded victims. It passed the Senate easily in March and is supported by the White House, but its fate in the House likely rests on whether House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) wants to bring it up.  Johnson has given no public hints as to which way heÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s leaning, but time is running out for the program, which was created in 1990 and has compensated about 40,000 people so far. The program was extended for two years in 2022, and claims can only be made through June 10.  The issue of who was compensated for theharmful collateral effects of the creation and testing of the U.S. nuclear arsenal Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u20ac¢ and who wasnÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢t Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u20ac¢ gained new prominence last year in part due to the Academy Award-winning film Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cOppenheimer.Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ The film dramatized scientistsÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢ race to make the first atom bomb, but was criticized for not showing the impact on residents near Trinity, the New Mexico site of the first test.  Advocates for so-called Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cdownwindersÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u20ac� people who were downwind of Trinity or a similar Cold War site in Nevada, but who are not currently eligible for compensation Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u20ac� were set to meet with Johnson staffers Thursday. Leger FernÃƒÂ¡ndez said she also talked with Johnson Tuesday.  Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cHe listened well and I was very appreciative of the fact that he listened,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ she said, adding that Johnson seemed Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201creceptiveÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ to the complaint that some victims had been compensated but others had not.  Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cI was encouraged by the fact that he recognized the importance of praying over this issue,Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201c she said.  A spokesperson for Johnson referred HuffPost to JohnsonÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s statement in March, when he was asked if he planned to bring up the bill after it passed the Senate on a 69-30 vote.  Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cObviously, the government has responsibility to take care of those who have been harmed by the governmentÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s action, as a general premise,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ Johnson said at the time. Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cBut we have to look at the details of that piece of legislation, as we do every one, and weÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢ll process it in due time.Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½  Hawley, whose state has a St. Louis-area creek contaminated by shoddy nuclear waste storage, said he was optimistic.  Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cThis is about, Ã¢â\u201a¬ËœCan the federal government poison all these people, lie about it for decades and then get away with it?Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ Hawley said Wednesday. Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cThis should be easy. The fact that it has been so difficult is sad, but I think weÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢ll get it done in the end.Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½  One factor that could complicate the billÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s fate is its price tag. It will not be cheap, and itÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s coming at a time when Republicans are hitting President Joe Biden for running large budget deficits.  The current program requires victims to have been in specific counties during testing Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u20ac¢ or to have had specific jobs that exposed them to radiation during weapons production, like uranium mining Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u20ac¢ and to have certain types of cancers associated with radiation exposure.  HawleyÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s bill would extend the program for another six years and expand geographic eligibility to include parts of new states and all of Nevada, Arizona and Utah. It would also broaden the illnesses covered to include leukemia and kidney problems.  A version of the bill that made it into a larger defense policy measure last year would have cost about $167 billion over 10 years, Hawley said. That version was dropped, and the bill that passed the Senate was a slimmed-down version. ItÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s expected to cost between $50 billion and $60 billion, according to unpublished correspondence between the Congressional Budget Office and lawmakers.  That could be a hefty price at a time when Republicans in particular are going out of their way to note the governmentÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s $34 trillion-plus in outstanding debt.  But Hawley and Leger FernÃƒÂ¡ndez said the cost should be looked at instead as part of the overall tab for national defense.  Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cYeah, when you poison millions of people, it costs money. And currently the billÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s being paid,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ Hawley said. Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cItÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s being paid by the veterans, itÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s being paid by the victims, itÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s being paid in lives lost.Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½  Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cThe cost of the nuclear test program was exposing communities to aboveground radiation, was dumping the nuclear waste into the systems in Missouri,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ Leger FernÃƒÂ¡ndez said. Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cThat was a cost. The question is, who pays the costs?Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½  Related...",

That speech follows months of U.S. military buildup in the waters off the coast of China, including placement of additional nuclear submarines around the Korean peninsula, all in the name of Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cprotectingÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ Taiwan, which is, of course, a part of China itself.  Undersecretary of State Bonnie Jenkins, the countryÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s top arms control official, told the Senate foreign relations committee last night that the U.S. worried China had increased its number of nuclear warheads to over 500, might have 1,000 by 2030, and that this was proof that the country was not Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201csincereÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ about its proposal to ban first use of the apocalypse-engendering weapons.  The Biden administrationÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s claim that China had increased the number of its warheads to 500 is just that Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u20acœ an unverified claim. In addition, the U.S. has 12 times that number with an admitted 6,000 of such warheads.  The U.S. says China refuses to engage in nuclear disarmament talks with it. China actually has engaged in talks, first by discussing with the U.S. the need for the U.S. to reduce its outrageously large number of missiles, as compared to ChinaÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s number, to show it is serious about fairness. And now it has added to those talks with its proposal to ban first use of the weapons.  ChinaÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s position is that it has an arsenal that is tiny in comparison with that of the United States and that the size of the arsenals has to be part of serious talks. China has also gotten India to sign onto a no-first-use deal between those two countries. While all these initiatives by China were underway the U.S. was busy unilaterally canceling nuclear arms deals between the U.S. and Russia and continuing to push expansion of NATO not just up to the borders of Russia but into the Pacific regions near China.  China also stores its warheads and delivery systems separately, to avoid the risk of launches by accident or misunderstanding, as almost happened in 1983, when Soviet lieutenant Stanislav Petrov recognized reports of incoming U.S. missiles as a system malfunction and prevented a retaliatory strike which could have begun World War III.  The new, highest-ever U.S. tariffs on Chinese products were announced by President Biden shortly before the Chinese peace initiatives were rejected by his administration. The tariffs would apply to government-subsidized Chinese steel, aluminum, solar cells, electric vehiclesÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u20ac�rising to 100% tariffs this yearÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u20ac�and their batteries, semiconductors, and some raw materials.  The Biden tariffs are much higher than the Trump tariffs that Biden opposed when Trump was president.  Biden is competing for the White House against the dangerous, right-wing Republican nominee, Donald Trump. The administration hopes that one result of imposing such high tariffs is that they will take the issue of TrumpÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s political gains from his hatred of China away from him.  As BidenÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s predecessor, Trump imposed 10% tariffs on all foreign steel and aluminum. They boomeranged and Trump had to backtrack when both the Steelworkers and Auto Workers pointed out how much of the steel and aluminum in cars, trucks and SUVs comes from Canada.  Biden criticized China for dumping products below Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201ccostÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ around the world and for Chinese government subsidies. The role of big corporations in creating the high costs, of course, are not a concern in U.S. big business circles. They oppose, of course, any low costs that might result from the efforts of a socialist government to provide subsidies to industries important to the working-class majorities in such countries. Chinese steelworkers are among the many millions of workers in that country that have been lifted out of poverty.  There are numerous administration policies, including the Inflation Reduction Act, the massive infrastructure programs and pro-environment measures that have boosted the economy and improved living standards for workers. Over the long haul, jingoistic attacks on countries like China and Russia and refusal to reduce the threat of nuclear war will work against the interests of U.S workers and everyone else on the planet.

    "article_text": "The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, has returned from a trip to Iran with a caution to Tehran: stop Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cloose talkÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ about the possibility of purusing a nuclear weapons program.  In an interview with The Guardian, Grossi said:  Loose talk about nuclear weapons is extremely serious for me. And I think it should stop. We are moving closer to a situation where there is a big, huge question mark about what they are doing and why they are doing it.  In the past week, there have been a series of statements from Tehran indicating that the Iran regimeÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s might set aside its long-standing pledge that it will not pursue an atomic bomb.  On April 18, the head of the Revolutionary Guards unit overseeing the security of nuclear facilities, said Iran can Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201creconsider its nuclear doctrineÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ if Israel attacked nuclear sites.  Four days later, hardline MP Javad Karimi Qoddousi claimed there was only Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201ca one-week gap from the issuance of the order to the first testÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ of a warhead.  QoddousiÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s remarks sparked pushback across the Iranian political spectrum, with accusations of Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cacting against national securityÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ and sidelining the fundamental issues of the Israeli war on Gaza. Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kanani on April categorically rejected that Iran was seeking nuclear weapons.  But last week Kamal Kharazi, the Supreme LeaderÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s foreign policy advisor and a former Foreign Minister, repeated the warning: Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cWe have no decision to build a nuclear bomb but should IranÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s existence be threatened, there will be no choice but to change our military doctrine.Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½  Grossi said the status of IAEA inspections of IranÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s sites, to ensure that it is pursuing only a civil nuclear program, is Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cin a very tight spotÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½.  Iran began restriction of inspections in early 2021, limiting the monitoring of sites and withholding all video from surveillance cameras. A new agreement in March 2023 restored some, but not all, of the scope of inspections.  Grossi said he is trying to negotiate detailed understandings but not another agreement. Meanwhile, some IAEA member states are preparing a censure motion for JuneÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s meeting of the Board of Governors.  Grossi, who visited Tehran and Isfahan last week, said to the Financial Times on his return that Iran showed a willingness to engage in Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cserious dialogueÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ over Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cconcreteÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ issues.  But he was far more cautious in the Guardian:  I try to make the most of what I can with the cards I have and have a process which is useful. And I think it is not only useful, it is indispensable unless you want to go to war or something like thisÃ¢â\u201a¬Â¦. I have been saying that without meaningful engagement, without us being able to have capacity to see and to see more in Iran, my ability to guarantee that everything is for peaceful uses in Iran would be limited and perhaps approaching the moment where I would not be able to say that any more.Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢ There would be a moment when I would draw a line. It would be a very critical juncture because the international community would have to grapple with the reality that we donÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢t know what Iran may or may not have and the countries will draw their conclusions.",

    "article_text": "Rep. Teresa Leger FernÃƒÂ¡ndez (D-N.M.) admits she doesnÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢t have a lot in common politically with Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.). But, she says, sometimes that doesnÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢t matter.  Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cOur communities share a common bond of the injustice and harms caused by nuclear testing,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ Leger FernÃƒÂ¡ndez told HuffPost Wednesday. Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cThat common bond means we share a common purpose in this legislation.Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½  The legislation in question would extend a program to compensate victims of WWII- and Cold War-era U.S. nuclear weapons production and testing, and expand the programÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s scope to include previously excluded victims. It passed the Senate easily in March and is supported by the White House, but its fate in the House likely rests on whether House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) wants to bring it up.  Johnson has given no public hints as to which way heÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s leaning, but time is running out for the program, which was created in 1990 and has compensated about 40,000 people so far. The program was extended for two years in 2022, and claims can only be made through June 10.  The issue of who was compensated for theharmful collateral effects of the creation and testing of the U.S. nuclear arsenal Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u20ac¢ and who wasnÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢t Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u20ac¢ gained new prominence last year in part due to the Academy Award-winning film Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cOppenheimer.Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ The film dramatized scientistsÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢ race to make the first atom bomb, but was criticized for not showing the impact on residents near Trinity, the New Mexico site of the first test.  Advocates for so-called Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cdownwindersÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u20ac� people who were downwind of Trinity or a similar Cold War site in Nevada, but who are not currently eligible for compensation Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u20ac� were set to meet with Johnson staffers Thursday. Leger FernÃƒÂ¡ndez said she also talked with Johnson Tuesday.  Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cHe listened well and I was very appreciative of the fact that he listened,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ she said, adding that Johnson seemed Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201creceptiveÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ to the complaint that some victims had been compensated but others had not.  Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cI was encouraged by the fact that he recognized the importance of praying over this issue,Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201c she said.  A spokesperson for Johnson referred HuffPost to JohnsonÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s statement in March, when he was asked if he planned to bring up the bill after it passed the Senate on a 69-30 vote.  Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cObviously, the government has responsibility to take care of those who have been harmed by the governmentÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s action, as a general premise,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ Johnson said at the time. Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cBut we have to look at the details of that piece of legislation, as we do every one, and weÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢ll process it in due time.Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½  Hawley, whose state has a St. Louis-area creek contaminated by shoddy nuclear waste storage, said he was optimistic.  Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cThis is about, Ã¢â\u201a¬ËœCan the federal government poison all these people, lie about it for decades and then get away with it?Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ Hawley said Wednesday. Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cThis should be easy. The fact that it has been so difficult is sad, but I think weÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢ll get it done in the end.Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½  One factor that could complicate the billÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s fate is its price tag. It will not be cheap, and itÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s coming at a time when Republicans are hitting President Joe Biden for running large budget deficits.  The current program requires victims to have been in specific counties during testing Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u20ac¢ or to have had specific jobs that exposed them to radiation during weapons production, like uranium mining Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u20ac¢ and to have certain types of cancers associated with radiation exposure.  HawleyÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s bill would extend the program for another six years and expand geographic eligibility to include parts of new states and all of Nevada, Arizona and Utah. It would also broaden the illnesses covered to include leukemia and kidney problems.  A version of the bill that made it into a larger defense policy measure last year would have cost about $167 billion over 10 years, Hawley said. That version was dropped, and the bill that passed the Senate was a slimmed-down version. ItÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s expected to cost between $50 billion and $60 billion, according to unpublished correspondence between the Congressional Budget Office and lawmakers.  That could be a hefty price at a time when Republicans in particular are going out of their way to note the governmentÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s $34 trillion-plus in outstanding debt.  But Hawley and Leger FernÃƒÂ¡ndez said the cost should be looked at instead as part of the overall tab for national defense.  Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cYeah, when you poison millions of people, it costs money. And currently the billÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s being paid,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ Hawley said. Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cItÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s being paid by the veterans, itÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s being paid by the victims, itÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s being paid in lives lost.Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½  Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cThe cost of the nuclear test program was exposing communities to aboveground radiation, was dumping the nuclear waste into the systems in Missouri,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ Leger FernÃƒÂ¡ndez said. Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cThat was a cost. The question is, who pays the costs?Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½  Related...",

    "article_text": "Alfie Allen (Game of Thrones), Shazad Latif (Star Trek: Discovery), and Samira Wiley (The HandmaidÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s Tale, Orange Is the New Black) are to star in the newly unveiled Sky original series Atomic.  The five-part Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cdynamic and action-fueled adventureÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ series will follow Max (Allen) and Mohammed (Latif) two unlikely friends who become swept up in a cartelÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s plot to transport uranium across North Africa and soon face an enormous decision: save themselves or risk everything to prevent a nuclear bomb falling into the wrong hands.  Pursued by Cassie Elliott (Wiley), a highly-skilled CIA agent, along with MI6 and a network of traffickers, Max and Mohammed find themselves, for once, having to be the good guys.  The show, from Gangs of London producer Pulse Films, is written by Gregory Burke (Ã¢â\u201a¬Ëœ71, Entebbe, Rebus) and directed by Shariff Korver (Temple, Do Not Hesitate).  Writer and executive producer Burke said: Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cI am thrilled to bring the world of Atomic to life with the brilliant director Shariff Korver and such a wonderful cast. It is a story about the terrifying prospect of a world where nuclear weapons are easier to acquire than ever before, and about the infinite possibilities that exist within the best of us and the worst of us.Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½  Inspired by the non-fiction book Atomic Bazaar by Vanity Fair journalist William Langewiesche, Atomic is produced by Pulse Films, a VICE Studios Group company, in association with Sky Studios. The series is directed by Shariff Korver and produced by Peter McAleese. Executive producers are Jamie Hall and Judy Counihan for Pulse Films, Thomas Benski, Gregory Burke, and Sam Hoyle and Megan Spanjian for Sky Studios.

Source: The Wall Street Journal  Details: Reportedly, in February 2022, a few weeks before Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russia launched the Kosmos 2553 research spacecraft into space.  Advertisement:  This satellite, American officials say, was designed to test components for a potential anti-satellite weapon that would carry a nuclear device.  Sources say Kosmos 2553 does not carry nuclear weapons, but American officials are certain it contains non-nuclear components of a new Russian armament system.  This armament, if deployed, will give Moscow an opportunity to destroy hundreds of satellites in low-Earth orbit with a nuclear blast \"in a part of space dominated by American government and SpaceX assets\".  One of the sources called the satellite a \"prototype\" of the weapon but others say that the Russian space programme has not advanced that far. Kosmos 2553 is still moving around the Earth on an \"unusual orbit\".  Over the last few months, US President Joe BidenÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s administration and Congress have been concerned about the alleged anti-satellite nuclear programme.  RussiaÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s Defence Ministry and Roscosmos reported about the launch of this satellite but little information concerning the purpose of the satellite was disclosed Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u20acœ only that it was equipped with the systems for operation \"under conditions of exposure to radiation and heavy charged particles\".  Sources of WSJ consider the claims of the Russian side about the goal of the spacecraft launch to be improbable and stress that it was launched within the Russian nuclear anti-satellite programme.

    "article_text": "WASHINGTON Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u20ac� Lawmakers and advocates rallied outside the U.S. Capitol Thursday, urging House lawmakers to extend a fund for victims of U.S. nuclear testing that is set to expire in less than a month.  But critics say the program is too expensive and should be winding down, and itÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s not clear if the House will act before the looming deadline.  New Mexico Democrats Sen. Ben Ray LujÃƒÂ¡n and Rep. Teresa Leger Fernandez, and GuamÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s Republican House delegate, James Moylan, among others, called on House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana to bring the legislation to the floor.  Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cWe stand with community members from across the United States, ranging from New Mexico, where they exploded the very first atomic bomb, to Guam to Missouri to Navajo to Utah to Colorado to people in Texas,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ Fernandez said. Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cCommunities that share a common bond of hardship, of death and of illness that came about because of the nationÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s program to build and test atomic weapons.Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½  Legislation to expand and extend the fund already passed the Senate in early March in a bipartisan 69-30 vote.  Advocates and survivors have long said they were not warned prior to nuclear testing and were forgotten in the following decades as the consequences of nuclear fallout and waste affected their families.  The Radiation Exposure Compensation Fund, often shortened to RECA, was established in 1990 and pays one-time sums to those who developed certain diseases after working on U.S. nuclear tests before 1963, or who lived in counties downwind from test explosion sites between January 1951 and October 1958, and the month of July in 1962, in Arizona, Nevada and Utah.  Uranium industry workers who were employed in 11 states from 1942 to 1971 who subsequently developed qualifying diseases also qualify.  The U.S. conducted more than 1,000 atomic weapons tests from 1945 to 1992 Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u20ac� the first at the Trinity Test site near Alamogordo, New Mexico, where the U.S. tested the atomic bomb during the Manhattan Project prior to dropping the weapons on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan at the end of World War II.  As of June 2022, the Justice Department has approved more than 36,000 RECA claims for more than $2.3 billion in benefits.  Unless the Radiation Exposure Compensation Fund is extended, claims have to be postmarked by June 10, 2024, according to the Department of Justice.  Ã¢â\u201a¬ËœUnknowing, unwilling, uncompensated victimsÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢  A small crowd of activists wore Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cSave RECAÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ buttons and matching yellow t-shirts bearing the message Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cWe are the unknowing, unwilling, uncompensated victims of the Manhattan Project and Cold War.Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½  A sign on the small lectern read, Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cSpeaker Johnson Pass RECA Before We Die.Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½  Dawn Chapman, co-founder of the St. Louis, Missouri-based Just Moms STL, told the crowd that she and advocates have been in lawmakersÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢ offices pushing for RECA to be taken up on the House floor.  Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cSpeaker JohnsonÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s staff has met as of this morning with two community groups, ours being one of them. We did meet with his office for an hour-and-a-half,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ she said.  Under the Senate-passed bill, championed by Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley, the fund would extend the program by six years and expand eligibility in several new locations, as well as add qualifying diseases.  As written and if passed, the fund would reach areas including ZIP codes in Alaska, Kentucky, Missouri and Tennessee, where communities were impacted by radioactive waste dumping, uranium processing and other related activities surrounding the testing.  The bill would also expand downwind areas to include Colorado, Idaho, Montana, New Mexico, and Guam and increase the one-time compensation sums to victims or surviving family to $100,000, up from $50,000 to $75,000.  Hawley was not able to attend the press conference due to a last-minute conflict, according to his fellow lawmakers. But in a statement posted to X Thursday, he said, Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cThe good people poisoned by their governmentÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s nuclear radiation have been put off long enough Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u20acœ itÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s time to make this right.Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½  In a statement to States Newsroom, a Johnson spokesperson said Wednesday that Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cThe Speaker understands and appreciates Senator HawleyÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s position and is working closely with interested members and stakeholders to chart a path forward for the House.Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½  Concerns over cost  Critics say the expansion would just be too costly.  An earlier iteration of the expansion, which received 61 votes in the Senate, was attached to last yearÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s massive annual defense authorization bill, but eventually lawmakers stripped it from the package.  According to an analysis by the watchdog group Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, the cost of the expansion was slated to reach $150 billion.  Hawley cut the cost in his revised legislation that garnered bipartisan Senate support in March. The new price tag went down to an estimated cost of $50 to $60 billion over 10 years after Hawley removed some qualifying diseases, cut the scope of medical benefits and shortened the extension from 19 years to six years, according to the CRFB.  Still, critics worry that the funds will be designated automatic mandatory spending, meaning funding couldnÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢t be adjusted from year to year by lawmakers like discretionary spending.  Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cCompensation may very well be warranted for individuals harmed by the governmentÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s nuclear activities, but the substantial deficit impact of the legislation is concerning and unnecessary,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget wrote in March. The organization also pointed out that the cost is not offset by other federal spending cuts.

    "article_text": "Sections Print  Editor's note: This piece is part of a series of policy analyses entitled Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cThe Talbott Papers on Implications of RussiaÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s Invasion of Ukraine,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ named in honor of American statesman and former Brookings Institution President Strobe Talbott. Brookings is grateful to Trustee Phil Knight for his generous support of the Brookings Foreign Policy program.  Since RussiaÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022, the threat of nuclear war has loomed over the conflict. Yet with President Vladimir PutinÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s latest announcement that Russia would hold exercises for tactical nuclear weapons use in combatÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u20ac�supposedly in response to Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cprovocative statementsÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ from Western officialsÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u20ac�RussiaÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s nuclear brinksmanship has possibly reached a new phase, in which higher risks need to be met with an upgraded Western deterrence posture. This deterrence is obviously different from the traditional war-prevention messaging because the high-intensity hostilities in Ukraine are progressing into year three. The theoretical model of deterrence in bello is, however, also not quite applicable because the war is uniquely asymmetric, with Ukraine fighting for its existence, Russia perceiving the battles as a part of an existential confrontation, and the West seeking to avoid any direct engagement while empowering Ukraine to win. The effectiveness of this new deterrence exercised by the West depends primarily on decisions made in Moscow, whose real-time assessments of the course of combat operations are complicated by its leadersÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢ opaque and highly personalized risk calculus. One key input for such assessments is the fact that PutinÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s new presidential term is off to a rocky start. The deadly terrorist attack targeting a concert in MoscowÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s Krasnogorsk suburb has signified a failure of the Russian special services, which were warned about the threat by the U.S. authorities. This disaster left the impression that PutinÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s reign, which started with the deadly explosions in Moscow in September 1999, has come full circle. MoscowÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s efforts to invent a Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cUkrainian connectionÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ are a natural diversion, but the problem with this blame-shifting is that the intensity of missile strikes on Kyiv, Odesa, Kharkiv, and Lviv cannot be raised any higher. By early May, it had become clear that Putin had failed to deliver a Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cpunishmentÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ that could have restored his credibility, which has been further compromised by RussiaÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s inability to respond to Ukrainian strikes on such strategic assets as the early-warning radar in Mordovia and the Tu-22M3 long-range bomber.  Rescue workers clean up the rubble of an eight-story Moscow building destroyed by a bomb, September 13, 1999. REUTERS. Members of the Russian Emergencies Ministry carry out search and rescue operations at the Crocus City Hall concert venue after a shooting attack and fire, outside Moscow, Russia, March 24, 2024. REUTERS.  Several international developments are also raising the pressure on Moscow. The U.S. CongressÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢ approval of a long-awaited aid package to Ukraine can potentially open a new path to victory for Kyiv. Together with the funding provided by the European Union and many European states, this support effectively closes the window of superiority that Russia has sought to exploit since the start of 2024, in which it failed to achieve a strategic breakthrough beyond the battle for Avdiivka, despite fierce attacks with heavy casualties. Thus, at a time when the Russian publicÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s support for perpetual war is eroding, Putin is facing the prospect of yielding the strategic initiative to Ukraine. He may find this future unacceptable. PutinÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s announcement of an exercise for non-strategic nuclear forces makes it probable that Russia may escalate its nuclear brinksmanship in the next few months, and this analysis aims to assess how MoscowÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s nuclear blackmail may take shape. It starts with a brief update on the nuclear capabilities that constitute the material basis of Russian strategic planning and proceeds to a short evaluation of how deterrence was applied in the first two years of the war. Consideration is then given to how RussiaÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s nuclear threats have sought to splinter European solidarity since the start of 2024 and to how Moscow may intensify these threats in response to the renewal of U.S. support to Ukraine.

    "article_text": "More than 300 US companies were defrauded in the effort, the Justice Department said in a separate release, announcing charges against Chapman and other alleged co-conspirators.  For three years, starting in October 2020, a US national named Christina Chapman of Arizona helped three North Korean IT workers obtain Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cillicit telework employmentÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ using the identities of US citizens, earning about US$6.8 million, the State Department said.  Posing as Americans, North Korean technology workers secured remote work contracts with hundreds of US companies as part of a scheme to help fund PyongyangÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s illicit nuclear weapons and missile programmes, the US government said on Thursday.  Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cThe charges describe a yearsÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢ long campaign by the North Korean government to infiltrate US job markets through fraud in an effort to raise revenue for the North Korean government and its illicit nuclear programme,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ the Justice Department said.  The North Korean workers also tried and failed to gain employment with Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u20acœ and information from Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u20acœ two US government agencies, according to the US. The workers are linked to North Korea Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s ballistic missile, weapons production and research and development programmes, the State Department said. The companies that hired the workers werenÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢t identified, nor were the agencies that didnÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢t hire them.  Chapman not only helped steal US identities but ran a Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201claptop farmÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ by hosting computers issued by the US companies on behalf of the North Korean workers, the Justice Department said, operating them from her home so that it looked like the North Korean workers were based in the US.  She also allegedly helped launder the proceeds with her own financial accounts by receiving, processing and distributing their pay cheques, the department added. That resulted in US companies to filing false documentation to the Department of Homeland Security and false reports to the Internal Revenue Service.  The US also charged Oleksandr Didenko of Kyiv, Ukraine, with engaging in a years-long effort to create accounts using false identities at US-based freelance IT job search platforms and money service companies, according to the Justice Department. He ran a platform that allowed remote IT workers to Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cbuy or rent accounts using identities other than their own on various platforms,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ the department said.  Facing a raft of US and United Nations sanctions for its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programmes, North Korea has turned to deploying IT workers overseas for government revenue, in addition to relying on cyberattacks and other online crimes, US and South Korean officials previously told Bloomberg.  The in-demand workers can make as much as US$300,000 a year working abroad, often working remotely through freelance platforms and using falsified or stolen identification, those officials said.  02:01 North KoreaÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s Kim Jong-un guides countryÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s 1st Ã¢â\u201a¬Ëœnuclear triggerÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢ simulation drills North KoreaÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s Kim Jong-un guides countryÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s 1st Ã¢â\u201a¬Ëœnuclear triggerÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢ simulation drills  The US State DepartmentÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s Rewards for Justice programme is offering as much as US$5 million for information that leads to the disruption of efforts to fund North KoreaÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s weapons programme.  North Korea is also known to use fake job offers to trick US employees into providing sensitive information.  The development comes after North Korean hackers for years have targeted American companies, launching ransomware attacks and conducting cryptocurrency thefts, as another way to raise money for weapons programmes. Suspected North Korean hackers also stole slightly more than US$1 billion in cryptocurrency last year, according to the blockchain analysis company Chainalysis Inc.",

A statement from South KoreaÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s Joint Chiefs of Staff gave no further details about the North Korean launch, such as how far the weapon flew.  North Korea in recent months has maintained an accelerated pace in weapons testing as it continues to expand its military capabilities while diplomacy with the United States and South Korea remained stalled. Observers say North Korea likely believes an upgraded weapons arsenal would give it leverage to win greater concessions from the U.S. if negotiations resume.  Last week, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un supervised another test firing of a new multiple rocket launch system, according to the NorthÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s state media.  North Korea has maintained it was forced to boost its nuclear and missile programs to deal with U.S.-led hostility. North Korea cites the expanded U.S.-South Korean military training that it calls invasion rehearsals.  On Thursday, two South Korean F-35As and two U.S. F-22 Raptors were mobilized for combined aerial exercises over the central region of South Korea. North Korea is extremely sensitive to the deployment of sophisticated U.S. aircraft.  Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The U.S. Justice Department has accused an American woman of being involved in a scheme that allegedly helped Kim Jong UnÃ¢â\u201a¬Ëœs North Korea fund its nuclear weapons program. The scheme involved more than 300 U.S. companies hiring foreign nationals with North Korean connections for remote IT work, the department said.  What Happened: The Justice Department has brought to light a massive fraud scheme that allegedly helped North Korea finance its nuclear weapons program. The scheme involved over 300 U.S. companies hiring foreign nationals with ties to North Korea for remote IT work, reported The Wall Street Journal.  The department alleges that the scheme, which has sent $6.8 million of revenue overseas, was orchestrated by an American citizen, an Arizona woman, and a Ukrainian man. The two have been arrested, while the authorities are searching for at least four other foreign co-conspirators.  The accused have been charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and identity theft, money laundering, and the unlawful employment of aliens. The federal government is offering a reward of up to $5 million for information related to the four alleged co-conspirators.  \"North Korea has weaponized its tech talent and created the ultimate insider threat,\" said Michael Barnhart, an analyst at Google's Mandiant intelligence division. The IT scams \"are providing a foothold into major organizations\" for North Korea's hackers, he said.

The countryÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s leader, Kim Jong Un, recently oversaw the testing of a new multiple rocket launch system, reinforcing its arsenal aimed at South Korean population centers. This move is seen as an escalation of tensions in the region.  North KoreaÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s nuclear ambitions have been a cause for concern for the international community. The countryÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s missile technology has even been linked to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.  Meanwhile, Western nations are seeking a new entity to oversee North Korea's adherence to international sanctions after Russia vetoed a UN panel that overlooked the country. This development, has raised concerns about the enforcement of sanctions against North Korea.

    "article_text": "Army Brig. Gen. Patrick Costello, commander of the 94th Army Air and Missile Defense Command, speaks at the Land Forces Pacific, or LANPAC, symposium on Waikiki Beach in Hawaii, May 15, 2024. (Wyatt Olson/Stars and Stripes)  HONOLULU Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u20ac� The Army remains on track to deliver a Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201ccompositeÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ missile-defense battalion that will become part of an integrated defense system for Guam, the commander of 94th Army Air and Missile Defense Command said Wednesday.  Guam is the test ground for the composite-battalion approach the Army will use to integrate its missile-defense capabilities, primarily the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD, and Patriot systems.  Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cI canÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢t comment on the exact timeline, but the Army remains on track on the commitments that theyÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢ve made to [U.S. Indo-Pacific Command] to deliver capability on time,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ Brig. Gen. Patrick Costello said during a question-and-answer session at the Land Forces Pacific, or LANPAC, symposium on Waikiki Beach.  Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cWe are making strides on a daily basis on improving our defensive posture in Guam,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ he said.  The 94th oversees the ArmyÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s air defenses in the Indo-Pacific region and integrates them with those of the joint force and U.S. allies.  The ArmyÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s Guam defense system will also employ the not-yet-fielded Indirect Fire Protection Capability, or IFPC Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u20ac� a mobile, ground-based system used to defeat cruise missiles, drones, rockets and mortars.  Costello said the Army will conduct the first live-fire testing of the integrated components on Guam before the end of the year.  Tying together the ArmyÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s missile defense for Guam will be made possible by the Integrated Air Missile Defense Battle Command System that will be fielded over the next couple of years, Costello said.  The command system, designed by Northrop Grumman, can link any sensor or radar to any weapon anywhere, bypassing stove-piping that has historically kept missile-defense systems isolated from one another.  Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cBy consolidating data from a number of different sensors, including radars, satellites and other partners and allies in the joint force, [the Battle Command System] creates a unified and comprehensive picture of the battlespace, providing expeditionary forces unparalleled situational awareness in decision-making capabilities,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ Costello said.  The ArmyÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s defense system will be just one part of the PentagonÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s integrated system planned for Guam.  Navy warships equipped with the Aegis Combat System and deployed as-needed to the region are also part of the plan, along with capabilities contributed by the Missile Defense Agency.  The ArmyÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office is overseeing the effort to integrate this overall Guam missile defense system.  Costello said the command system will require fundamentally changing how the 94th organizes and deploys assets and personnel.  Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cIf we have things called THAAD batteries, Patriot battalions, IFPC battalions, divisional air defense battalions in the future, weÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢re doing something wrong,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ he said.  Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cWeÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢re not keeping up with the threat by having different formations for different threats. One formation needs to handle a wide variety of threats.Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½  Costello compared the new composite formations to the Marine CorpsÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢ air-ground task force units, which are formed to accomplish a specific task under a single commander.  Establishing the Guam defense system will be Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cthe first foray for the [Army] into organizing and operating as a composite organization,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ Costello said.  Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cUnlike traditional single component units, composite battalions will be uniquely structured to integrate multiple assets and capabilities into a unified force,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ he said.",

    "article_text": "Seoul, South Korea Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u20ac� North Korea fired suspected short-range ballistic missiles off its east coast on Friday, South Korea's military said, a day after South Korea and the U.S. flew powerful fighter jets in a joint drill that the North views as a major security threat.  South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said the launches were made from the Wonsan region of the North's east coast around 3:10 p.m. It said South Korea's military had bolstered its surveillance posture and was maintaining readiness.  In recent months, North Korea has extended its run of weapons testing as part of its efforts to enlarge and modernize its arsenal while diplomacy with the United States and South Korea remains dormant. Last week, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un supervised the test firing of a new multiple rocket launch system, according to the North's state media.  North Korea says it's been forced to boost its nuclear and missile programs to deal with U.S.-led hostilities. North Korea cites expanded U.S.-South Korean military training, which it calls an invasion rehearsal.  Many foreign experts say North Korea uses its rivals' military drills as a pretext for building a larger weapons arsenal in the belief that it would boost its leverage in future diplomacy with the U.S.  A TV screen shows a file image of a North Korean missile launch during a news program at the Seoul Railway Station in Seoul, South Korea, on May 17, 2024. Ahn Young-joon / AP  On Thursday, two South Korean F-35As and two U.S. F-22 Raptors were mobilized for combined aerial exercises over the central region of South Korea. North Korea is extremely sensitive to the deployment of sophisticated U.S. aircraft.  Earlier Friday, Kim's sister and senior official Kim Yo Jong said North Korea's recent weapons tests were part of the country's five-year arms buildup plan launched in 2021. She said the recently tested weapons are designed to attack Seoul, the South Korean capital, and denied outside speculation that the tests were meant to display weapons that North Korea plans to export to Russia to use in its war with Ukraine.  \"We don't conceal the fact that such weapons will be used to prevent Seoul from inventing any idle thinking,\" Kim Yo Jong said in a statement carried by state media.  South Korea's Unification Ministry, which deals with North Korea, responded that it is fully ready to repel any military threats from North Korea in conjunction with its military alliance with the United States. Deputy ministry spokesperson Kim Inae also said that \"illegal\" arms deals between North Korea and Russia must be stopped immediately.    Agence France-Presse notes that Seoul claimed in March that Pyongyang had sent some 7,000 containers of arms to Russia for use in Ukraine since roughly July 2023.  Experts say North Korea wants a range of military aid from Russia in return, such as satellite technology and the upgrading of its Soviet-era military equipment.",

    "article_text": "WASHINGTON DC: The US military warned that China is moving forward with developing floating nuclear reactors in the South China Sea to hold up its claim to the disputed maritime territory, a development, which analysts have stressed would pose risks to the environment, reported Voice of America (VOA).According to analysts, the plan to build ships with mobile nuclear power sources would raise tensions with its neighbours and pose risks to the environment.Chinese media reports described the marine nuclear power platforms as small plants inside ships that would act as mobile \"power banks\" at sea for stationary facilities and other ships, VOA reported.However, Beijing had suspended the project a year ago over safety and effectiveness concerns, according to the South China Morning Post.But this month, the outgoing commander of the US Indo-Pacific Command and State Department Admiral John Aquilino said that China is still building the floating reactors to supply power to disputed islands, the Washington Post reported.Although the US officials said that the deployment of such reactors would take several years, Admiral John Aquilino said their development would undermine regional security and stability, VOA reported.Following this, last week, the Philippines echoed those concerns.Philippines National Security Council Assistant Director General Jonathan Malaya said that China would use its floating reactors to power military bases it has built on artificial islands, including those within the Philippines' exclusive economic zone.He added that China's nuclear plants would further militarize disputed areas of the South China Sea.\"Anything that supports their military presence in those islands is technically a threat to our national security and against our interests,\" he said, adding that Australia and the US would be among Manila's allies conducting joint patrols in the South China Sea, as reported by VOA.According to Beijing's claims, they have control over almost the entire South China Sea, putting it in dispute with Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam.Moreover, China has already built artificial islands with airport runways to strengthen its claims.The analysts said that Beijing's floating reactors would not only strengthen its military presence in the area but also give it an excuse to extend its reach through security actions, VOA reported.Song Yanhui, director of the International Law Society of the Republic of China, Taiwan, said that the current military security zone for China's artificial islands is a radius of 500 meters (1,640 feet), which means, other aircraft and ships that enter this radius can be legitimately expelled.Song continued that if China deploys a floating nuclear power plant in the South China Sea, it could use the excuse of protecting the environment from radioactive pollution to drive away ships from a larger area or to take defensive measures.For Beijing, he said, \"It kills two birds with one stone. It is a win-win strategy. It can strengthen its military presence, civilian use and claim to sovereignty.\"But the potential for radiation leaks is a real concern, analysts said, reported VOA.Pankaj Jha, dean of research at the School of International Affairs of India's Jindal Global University, highlighted that China's lack of experience in operating such floating reactors could spell disaster.\"It is a threat because it will contaminate water and also surrounding areas,\" he said. \"Any radiation leak would make the island uninhabitable and might also impact fishermen from the South China Sea.\"In the event of a conflict with China, the analysts further noted that the floating reactors could also become military targets, reported VOA.China has deployed radars, anti-ship and anti-aircraft missiles, and fighter jets, among other weapons, on the disputed territories of Mischief Reef, Subi Reef and Fiery Cross, the three largest artificial islands in the Spratly Islands.Richard Fisher, senior fellow with the International Assessment and Strategy Center, stressed that floating nuclear power plants could also one day extend China's weapons capabilities.\"If they were protected, these nuclear power plants could also potentially power future energy weapon devices,\" Fisher said. \"Laser weapons that could knock down missiles and aircraft or very powerful microwave weapons could also disable missiles and aircraft that would get within their range.\"Notably, China is not the first country to think of building floating nuclear reactors.The US took the lead in proposing the concept in 1970 but due to safety concerns, they did not quickly pursue development, reported VOA.Meanwhile, Russia is the only country that has brought a floating nuclear power plant to fruition, with the Akademik Lomonosov plant producing electricity and heating since 2020 from a harbour in Pevek, a town in the Arctic Circle.Earlier in November last year, the International Atomic Energy Agency at a forum in Vienna expressed concern about the development of floating nuclear reactors, particularly when they cross international borders or operate in international waters.\"The IAEA is working with our member states to determine what further guidance and standards might be needed to ensure the safety of floating nuclear power plants,\" IAEA Deputy Director General Lydie Evrard said in a press release.The IAEA further noted that Canada, China, Denmark, South Korea, Russia and the US are each working on marine-based \"small modular reactor designs.\"",

    "article_text": "North Korea has fired suspected short-range ballistic missiles off its east coast a day after South Korea and the U.S. flew powerful fighter jets in a drill that the North views as a major security threat  SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korea fired suspected short-range ballistic missiles off its east coast on Friday, South KoreaÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s military said, a day after South Korea and the U.S. flew powerful fighter jets in a joint drill that the North views as a major security threat.  South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said the weapons launched from the North's east coast Wonsan region traveled about 300 kilometers (185 miles) before landing in the waters between the Korean Peninsula and Japan. JapanÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said a North Korean missile landed outside Japan's exclusive economic zone.  South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff statement called the launches Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201ca clear provocationÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ that threatens peace on the Korean Peninsula. It said South Korea will maintain a firm readiness to repel potential aggressions by North Korea in conjunctions with the military alliance with the United States.  North Korea has extended its run of weapons testing in recent months as part of its efforts to enlarge and modernize its arsenal while diplomacy with the United States and South Korea remains stalled. Last week, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un supervised the test firing of a new multiple rocket launch system, according to the NorthÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s state media.  North Korea says it has been forced to boost its nuclear and missile programs to deal with U.S.-led hostilities. North Korea cites expanded U.S.-South Korean military training, which it calls an invasion rehearsal. Many foreign experts say North Korea uses its rivals' military drills as a pretext for building a larger weapons arsenal in the belief that it would boost its leverage in future diplomacy with the U.S.  On Thursday, two South Korean F-35As and two U.S. F-22 Raptors were mobilized for a combined aerial exercise over the central region of South Korea. North Korea is extremely sensitive to the deployment of sophisticated U.S. aircraft. It was reportedly the first deployment of a U.S. F-22 to South Korea in seven months.  The North's official Korean Central News Agency said Friday the re-deployment of the U.S. F-22s for joint training with South Korea is Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201canother clear proof of the hostile nature of the U.S.Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ which seeks Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201ca showdown of forceÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ with North Korea. KCNA accuses Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cthe military gangstersÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ of South Korea of intensifying tensions to keep pace with Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201ctheir master's confrontation schemeÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ against the North.  It warned the F-22s flyovers Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cwill only precipitate the advent of a situation that the U.S. does not want to see.\" But it didn't elaborate what steps North Korea would take.  Also Friday, Kim's sister and senior official Kim Yo Jong said North KoreaÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s recent weapons tests were part of the countryÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s five-year arms buildup plan launched in 2021. She said the recently tested weapons are designed to attack Seoul, the South Korean capital, and denied outside speculation that the tests were meant to display weapons that North Korea plans to export to Russia.  Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cWe donÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢t conceal the fact that such weapons will be used to prevent Seoul from inventing any idle thinking,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ Kim Yo Jong said in a statement carried by KCNA.  __  Associated Press writer Mari Yamaguchi in Tokyo contributed to this report.",

Hasard du calendrier, cÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢est la veille, le 15 mai, aprÃƒÂ¨s une semaine de manÃ\u2026â\u20acœuvre, quÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢EDF a achevÃƒÂ© le premier chargement dÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢uranium dans le cÃ\u2026â\u20acœur de son rÃƒÂ©acteur EPR de Flamanville (Manche).

    "article_text": "Iran may be mere weeks away from developing nuclear weapons , according to the director general of the UNÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s nuclear agency.  Rafael Grossi, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the UNÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s nuclear oversight organization, flew to Iran last week to strengthen the UNÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s supervision of Iranian nuclear activities.  4 View gallery Tehran ( Photo: Atta Kenare / AP )  Iran has agreed to provide the agency with information about its nuclear facilities and access to cameras at its nuclear sights. Since 2022, many surveillance cameras have been removed, and traces of uranium have been found in unexpected locations.  While in Iran, Grossi met with Mohammad Eslami, IranÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s nuclear chief.  Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cIran has never been closer to achieving a nuclear bomb,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ Grossi told the press after his visit to Iran. Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cIt is estimated that it may be a matter of weeks and not months away if [Supreme Leader Ali] Khamenei chooses to go this way.Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½  In 2018, Donald TrumpÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s administration decided to withdraw from the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and the U.S. Under the deal, Iran agreed to limit its uranium stockpile and enrich uranium only to 3.67%, the purity needed to run nuclear power plants. In return, Iran received relief from sanctions imposed by the US, the EU, and the UN Security Council.  The U.S. withdrawal from the nuclear deal has not stopped IranÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s nuclear plan. In fact, Tehran has used the withdrawal as an excuse to roll back cooperation with the IAEA and accelerate its uranium enrichment.  Darya Dolzikova, a research fellow at the Royal United Services InstituteÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s Proliferation and Nuclear Policy program, told The Media Line that Iran has achieved 60% uranium purity and is approaching the weapons-grade purity level of 90%.  4 View gallery Donald Trump ( Photo: SARAH YENESEL / POOL / AF )  Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cThis is quite concerning,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ she said.  Steven Biegalski, the chair of the Nuclear and Radiological Engineering and Medical Physics Program at Georgia Institute of Technology, said that 60% purity is Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cfar beyondÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ the purity needed for nuclear power plants.  Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cIt is, of course, a huge concern,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ he said. Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cThey are clearly staging themselves to reach their goal in one or two weeks without having any significant international sanctions against them.Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½  Dolzikova said that while producing sufficient fissile material for a nuclear weapon could take about a week, producing additional weapons would take longer.  Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cOnce the uranium is enriched, it must be put inside a nuclear weapon, and then it is mounted onto a delivery system,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ she said. Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cSo, to produce more of them it actually takes longer, up from six months to a year.Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½  Daryl G. Kimball, the executive director of the U.S.-based Arms Control Association, explained that monitoring IranÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s nuclear capacity has been difficult because the country has not provided the IAEA with all the necessary information.  Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cThere are certain facilities that this institution has no access to since Iran has decertified its inspectors from some of them,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ Kimball stated.  4 View gallery Iranian flag ( Photo: Shutterstock )  He called for the U.S., France, Germany, and the UK to push Iran to resume cooperation with the IAEA.  Iran becoming a nuclear power would set off a chain reaction in the Middle East and around the world. Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cSeveral other countries may develop a clandestine military nuclear capability,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ Simon Henderson, the director of the Gulf and Energy Policy Program at the Washington Institute, told The Media Line. Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cEgypt, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE are regarded as the most likely. Moreover, Iran is clearly showing, by continuing the nuclear program, not only the impossibility to stop this through international policies but mainly the limits of the American power, its main enemy.Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½  According to Kimball, an Israeli or American strike on Iranian nuclear facilities would not bring an end to IranÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s nuclear program. Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cThis can even escalate in the countryÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s withdrawal from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty to pursue in the long run a nuclear arsenal, which may protect the regime from foreign threats.Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½  IranÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s nuclear plant in Natanz is enriching uranium at a faster rate than ever before, and the countryÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s stock of uranium fuel continues to increase.  4 View gallery Iranian uranium enrichment facility ( Photo: AFP )  Iran started building the new underground facility in Natanz to replace the aboveground centrifuge assembly center, which was struck by an explosion in 2020. Iran claimed it was IsraelÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s responsibility.  Kimball said the new facility was built deep underground in order to avoid being targeted.  Biegalski said that Iran has clearly disobeyed the UNÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s limits, installing additional centrifuges to reach higher uranium enrichment.  Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cWithout military action and only the use of policies, it is almost impossible to stop this process,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ he said.  The Iranian government has consistently stated that it has no intention of creating nuclear weapons, but after last monthÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s escalation between Iran and Israel, Kamal Kharazi, KhameneiÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s adviser, took a different tack.  Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cIf the Zionist regime [Israel] will launch an attack on our nuclear sites, our deterrence will change. We have the capability to create nuclear weapons, and we may use them in the future to protect ourselves,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ Kharazi said in an interview with Al Jazeera.

The U.S. military did not immediately acknowledge the incident However, If confirmed, this would be yet another Reaper downed by the Houthis as they press their campaign over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip.  Houthi military spokesman Brig. Gen. Yahya Saree claimed that rebels shot down the Reaper on Thursday with a surface-to-air missile, promising to later release footage of the attack. He described the drone as \"carrying out hostile actions\" in Yemen's Marib province, which remains held by allies of Yemen's exiled, internationally recognized government.

While the rebels have made claims about attacks that turned out later not to be true, they have a history of shooting down U.S. drones and have been armed by their main benefactor, Iran, with weapons capable of high-altitude attack.  Image: Getty Images) Getty Images)  Since the Houthis seized the country's north and its capital of Sanaa in 2014, the U.S. military has previously lost at least five drones to the rebels. Reapers, which cost around Ã\u201aÂ£20million ($30 million apiece), can fly at altitudes up to 50,000 feet and have an endurance of up to 24 hours before needing to land.

Image: Getty Images) Getty Images)  The drone shootdown comes as the Houthis launch attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, demanding Israel ends the war in Gaza, which has killed more than 34,000 Palestinians there. The war began after Hamas-led militants attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people and taking some 250 others hostage.  The Houthis have launched more than 50 attacks on shipping, seized one vessel and sunk another since November, according to the U.S. Maritime Administration. Houthi attacks have dropped in recent weeks as the rebels have been targeted by a U.S.-led airstrike campaign in Yemen. Shipping through the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden still remains low because of the threat, however.",

    "article_text": "SEOUL, South Korea Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u20ac� North Korea fired suspected short-range ballistic missiles off its east coast on Friday, South KoreaÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s military said, a day after South Korea and the U.S. flew powerful fighter jets in a joint drill that the North views as a major security threat.  South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said the weapons launched from the North's east coast Wonsan region traveled about 300 kilometers (185 miles) before landing in the waters between the Korean Peninsula and Japan. JapanÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said a North Korean missile landed outside Japan's exclusive economic zone.  South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff statement called the launches Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201ca clear provocationÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ that threatens peace on the Korean Peninsula. It said South Korea will maintain a firm readiness to repel potential aggressions by North Korea in conjunctions with the military alliance with the United States.  North Korea has extended its run of weapons testing in recent months as part of its efforts to enlarge and modernize its arsenal while diplomacy with the United States and South Korea remains stalled. Last week, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un supervised the test firing of a new multiple rocket launch system, according to the NorthÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s state media.  North Korea says it has been forced to boost its nuclear and missile programs to deal with U.S.-led hostilities. North Korea cites expanded U.S.-South Korean military training, which it calls an invasion rehearsal. Many foreign experts say North Korea uses its rivals' military drills as a pretext for building a larger weapons arsenal in the belief that it would boost its leverage in future diplomacy with the U.S.  On Thursday, two South Korean F-35As and two U.S. F-22 Raptors were mobilized for a combined aerial exercise over the central region of South Korea. North Korea is extremely sensitive to the deployment of sophisticated U.S. aircraft. It was reportedly the first deployment of a U.S. F-22 to South Korea in seven months.  The North's official Korean Central News Agency said Friday the re-deployment of the U.S. F-22s for joint training with South Korea is Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201canother clear proof of the hostile nature of the U.S.Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ which seeks Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201ca showdown of forceÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ with North Korea. KCNA accuses Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cthe military gangstersÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ of South Korea of intensifying tensions to keep pace with Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201ctheir master's confrontation schemeÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ against the North.  It warned the F-22s flyovers Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cwill only precipitate the advent of a situation that the U.S. does not want to see.\" But it didn't elaborate what steps North Korea would take.  Also Friday, Kim's sister and senior official Kim Yo Jong said North KoreaÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s recent weapons tests were part of the countryÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s five-year arms buildup plan launched in 2021. She said the recently tested weapons are designed to attack Seoul, the South Korean capital, and denied outside speculation that the tests were meant to display weapons that North Korea plans to export to Russia.  Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cWe donÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢t conceal the fact that such weapons will be used to prevent Seoul from inventing any idle thinking,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ Kim Yo Jong said in a statement carried by KCNA.  __  Associated Press writer Mari Yamaguchi in Tokyo contributed to this report.",

The South Korean military did not immediately provide more details, including the distance traveled. Japan's Defense Ministry did not report the launches, but government officials told NHK that the weapons were likely short-range.  \"Our military has ramped up monitoring and vigilance against additional launches, while closely sharing information related to North Korean ballistic missiles with the U.S. and Japanese authorities,\" the South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement.  Earlier Friday, Kim Yo Jong, the sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, said in a statement carried by state-run media that her country's ballistic missiles were intended solely as a deterrent against South Korean military moves, denying that Pyongyang was exporting the weapons.  Friday's launches also come just a day after the South Korean and U.S. militaries held joint drills involving advanced stealth fighter jets.  North Korea has conducted a spate of weapons tests this year, including its first drills simulating a nuclear counterattack under its Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cnuclear triggerÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ management system in an exercise overseen by Kim Jong Un in April.  Late last month, the North conducted a test of a large liquid-fueled rocket engine, according to an analysis of imagery by a U.S. think tank, with Pyongyang appearing to be gearing up for another spy satellite launch soon.  North Korea successfully launched its first military reconnaissance satellite last November after two earlier failures. Days later, the country said that it would launch three additional spy satellites sometime this year.",

The U.S. has also placed restrictions on weapons it supplies, telling Kyiv they must not be used to strike inside Russia.  Ukrainian leaders have long chafed at the prohibition imposed by allies on using Western-supplied weapons to strike across Russian borders. In a recent interview with POLITICO, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said he felt the West has been requiring Ukraine to fight with one hand tied behind its back because of the strings that come attached to military aid.  UkraineÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s Volodymyr Zelenskyy acknowledged Friday that Russian forces have advanced in one area in Kharkiv oblast but assured Ukrainians the situation was stabilizing. Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cToday, our defense forces have stabilized the Russians where they are now,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ he said.  In a post on X, Zelenskyy said: Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cRussia has not stopped terrorizing our people for a single week in more than two years of this war. Russia tries to expand the war while consistently making empty statements about peace. We must use all available means to force Russia to make a real and just peace. Our defense against Russian assaults and strikes is critical in this regard.Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½  Meanwhile, Oleksandr Syrskyi, commander-in-chief of Ukraine's armed forces, said his troops are readying for a possible Russian offensive on the neighboring oblast of Sumy, 300 kilometers northeast of Kyiv, in a likely bid to force Ukraine to divert troops.",

KCNA warns that these maneuvers involve the deployment of \"advanced military equipment, including strategic assets,\" and are designed to \"fully implement the final stage of nuclear war plans.\"  \"These exercises prove that the annoying statements of the United States about the \"absence of hostile intentions\" are just a hypocritical deception,\" the commentary says. \"The situation in which it is impossible to predict when and how the \"nuclear strike\" exercises aimed against our republic and planned near our southern border will turn into real hostilities shows that one can only believe one's own overwhelming force, and not the words of the enemy,\" the agency noted.  If the United States \"together with its henchmen want to test the will and strength\" of the DPRK through provocations, then they should first think about the \"catastrophic consequences,\" the article says. \"Whether or not the United States has hostile intentions towards us, we will determine by actions, not statements,\" KCNA concluded.  ---  Follow us on Twitter @AzerNewsAz",

Not all such mistakes can be corrected, however. Some damage is permanent.  Assuming Iran acquires nuclear weapons while Biden is in office, there is no realistic possibility that we will ever get Tehran to give up its nuclear capability. We and the world will be living in a world in which the mad ayatollahs have the ability to vaporize Tel Aviv, Riyadh, Cairo, and all the other major cities of the region.  So, how close to having the bomb are the Iranians? Are we sure they donÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢t have it?  According to one Iranian lawmaker, the Iranians already have operational nuclear weapons.  Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cIn my opinion, we have achieved nuclear weapons, but we do not announce it. It means our policy is to possess nuclear bombs, but our declared policy is currently within the framework of the JCPOA. The reason is that when countries want to confront others, their capabilities must be compatible, and IranÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s compatibility with America and Israel means that Iran must have nuclear weapons.Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½  Ahmad Bakhshayesh Ardestani, member of the Iranian Parliament.  Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cIn a climate where Russia has attacked Ukraine and Israel has attacked Gaza, and Iran is a staunch supporter of the Resistance Front, it is natural for the containment system to require that Iran possess nuclear bombs. However, whether Iran declares it is another matter,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ Ardestani added.",

Following the US' deployment of medium-range ballistic missiles, China also urges the Philippines not to serve as a pawn and a tool of hegemony, Zhang said.The Chinese Foreign Ministry has repeated basic facts on the situation at Ren'ai Jiao, and the Chinese Embassy in the Philippines has also released relevant information about the communication between the two sides. The facts are clear, the evidence is conclusive, and can't be denied, said Zhang.Based on humanitarian considerations, China has reached a \"gentlemen's agreement,\" or internal understandings with the Philippines on properly managing the situation at Ren'ai Jiao, which is conducive to managing differences, avoiding conflicts, building mutual trust, and maintaining peace and stability in the relevant waters. However, the Philippines has resorted to all sorts of denials, deceiving the Filipino people and misleading the international community. Where is their credibility, and what are their intentions, Zhang asked.The Chinese military does not wish to make trouble but is not afraid of trouble. If someone wants to pull a banner and form alliances to coerce and pressure China, they are totally wrong, Zhang said in response to the Philippines' contradictory words and actions.China urges the Philippines not to act recklessly and to stop all infringement and provocation, Zhang said. China will continue to take resolute measures to firmly defend its territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests, and maintain peace and stability in the South China Sea, he said.In response to the US' deployment of the \"Typhon\" Mid-Range Capability missile system to Luzon, the Philippines, Zhang said that the move seriously undermined China's strategic security, seriously damaging regional peace and stability. China has repeatedly expressed its firm opposition to this, said the spokesperson.During recent years, the US has continuously withdrawn from arms control agreements, undermining the arms control treaty system and causing a serious impact on global strategic security and stability.Countries that willingly serve as tools of hegemony, deploying highly aggressive strategic offensive weapons for other countries, will only increase their own security risks, Zhang noted.China urges the US to take seriously the regional security concerns and to stop dangerous moves that escalate regional tensions, Zhang said, adding that China will take resolute and effective measures to safeguard its own security interests.Global Times",

    "article_text": "Inside a large manufacturing building on the northwest side, officials at Cardinal Health are busy at work on their latest expansion project, yet another clean room for nuclear medicine.  Already, workers have erected massive walls of thick lead weighing hundreds of tons to shield technicians against radiation.  Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cThereÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s still one more layer [of lead] to go on,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ said Shane Thrasher, vice president of nuclear manufacturing. Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cThatÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s for the appropriate amount of radioactive shielding from whatÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s inside.Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½  WhatÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s inside, when the project is completed, will be large commercial batches of actinium 225, an isotope that can be infused into a patient in small doses with the goal of destroying or shrinking cancer cells with more precision than chemotherapy and with fewer side effects.  Already, Cardinal Health has spent more than $50 million in the past three years on the plant, named the Center for Theranostics (a combination of Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201ctherapeuticsÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cdiagnosticsÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½), to meet huge demand for nuclear medical products that are known as radiopharmaceuticals.  ItÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s a booming industry, with a large cluster in central Indiana. And the roster of players has surged in the past few years to include some of the worldÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s leading pharmaceutical companies, attracted by the potential for significant growth.  Companies as far away as France, Switzerland and Israel have invested billions of dollars in radiopharmaceutical manufacturing assets in central Indiana. They are attracted by the regionÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s central location, workforce talent and long history in pharmaceutical drug-making.  Last year, Indianapolis-based Eli Lilly and Co.Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u20ac�better known for its long history in insulins, antidepressants and traditional cancer drugsÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u20ac�jumped into the radiopharmaceutical business by buying Point Biopharma Global Inc., an Indianapolis-based startup, for $1.4 billion. Point had recently built a 77,000-square-foot manufacturing plant off Georgetown Road to develop radioactive compounds.  Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cWeÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢re really excited about bringing radiopharmaceuticals into the portfolio by way of the acquisition of Point Biopharma,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ Jacob Van Naarden, president of LillyÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s oncology business, said during an earnings conference call last month. Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cWe are supplementing that acquisition with additional work through our discovery labs and the ability to make these medicines ourselves.Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½  In April, Switzerland-based Novartis AG held an open house for its new, 70,000-square-foot manufacturing plant near the Indianapolis International Airport that cost $100 million. Just a few months earlier, federal regulators approved the facility to make Pluvicto, a radiopharmaceutical medication to treat advanced-stage prostate cancer.  Novartis acquired the rights to Pluvicto when it bought West Lafayette-based startup Endocyte Inc. for $2.1 billion in 2018. Last year, Pluvicto brought in $980 million in sales.  In February, New Jersey-based pharmaceutical giant Bristol Myers Squibb Co. jumped into the game when it acquired a San Diego startup, RayzeBio Inc., for $4.1 billion. The deal included a 64,000-square-foot manufacturing plant that RayzeBio renovated in Indianapolis to make isotopes for targeted therapy of gastroenteropancreatic and neuroendocrine tumors.  In Westfield, an Israel-based company, Isotopia, is building 28,000 square feet of clean rooms, labs and other space at a cost of $20 million. The companyÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s first U.S. facility will make radioactive medical isotopes for targeted cancer treatments.  And two years ago, Australia-based Telix Pharmaceuticals, with U.S. headquarters in Fishers, dosed its first patient with a new imaging agent designed to target and light up prostate cancer cells so doctors can see them. Last year alone, the drug, known as Illuccix, rang up more than $500 million in sales.  At the crossroads  Central Indiana is emerging as perhaps the largest nuclear medicine cluster in the United States, due to a wide mix of factors that include the regionÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s central location, which allows products to be shipped quickly across the nation. ThatÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s critical for radiopharmaceuticals, which begin to decay immediately after being manufactured and have an extremely short shelf life. Unlike most pills, radiopharmaceuticals often last less than a week or two and need to be shipped to hospitals and clinics just-in-time for use.  IndianaÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s central location, coupled with an airport that houses the second-largest FedEx hub in the world, is a tough combination to beat, officials say.  And then thereÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s Purdue University, about an hour northwest of Indianapolis, which houses the nationÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s oldest and largest nuclear pharmacy program. The program, set up in the 1970s, trains not only pharmacists but also nuclear medicine technicians, radiation safety officers and other professionals in the nuclear industry.  The industry is growing, among other reasons, because researchers have been better able to develop drugs, called ligands, that act like self-guided missiles and seek out cancer cells based on certain biomarkers that are unique to cancer.  After being infused, the ligands are metabolized into the bloodstream and rapidly begin traveling throughout the body, binding to cancer cells.  In the process, they carry a radioisotope that acts like a nuclear warhead on a missile. But instead of exploding, the radioisotope decays, releasing particles that cause damage to the cancer cellÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s DNA, destroying the cell.  Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cIf you look at some of the early results, this is just another treatment option for patients with cancer,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ said Kara Weatherman, a Purdue clinical professor of pharmacy who leads the schoolÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s nuclear pharmacy program. Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cChemotherapy, obviously, has some significant negative aspects of treating. And so, I think as the population gets older, as the incidence of cancer goes up, having multiple options for treatment is very logical.Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½  Buying technology  Todd Hockemeyer, CEO of IsotopiaÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s U.S. operations, said he isnÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢t surprised that large pharmaceutical companies are scooping up radiopharmaceutical startups and their Indiana manufacturing assets.  Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cI think the industry is waking up to the fact that radiotherapeutics is another arrow in the quiver,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ he told IBJ. Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cIf youÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢re in the oncology marketplace, this is something thatÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s got to be in your portfolio.Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½  Hockemeyer, who previously built a factory in Indianapolis for Point Biopharma, said the radiopharmaceutical industry has specialized knowledge that is very different from that of traditional pharmaceutical players. As a result, those traditional companies are more likely to buy or partner with smaller companies that have developed highly promising drugs or manufacturing assets.  Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cI think they realized that, Ã¢â\u201a¬ËœLook, this would be very difficult for us to organically dig this out of the ground. So letÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s go buy something,Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ Hockemeyer said.  Even large nuclear medicine companies are joining the shopping spree. In 2020, Curium, a nuclear medicine company with headquarters in London and Paris, purchased Zevacor Molecular, one of the first radiopharmaceuticals players in central Indiana, which had built a $10 million plant in Noblesville. Curium said it would invest another $10 million at the site.  Mike Bolinder, a former Lilly executive, said the industry research and development model has shifted in the past decade or so from trying to develop all drugs in-house to working with startups that do the intensive early work of raising venture capital and developing products.  Then, if something pans out, the large pharmaceutical companies can try to buy or license the product and add it to their pipeline, said Bolinder, who is now senior vice president at BioCrossroads, an Indianapolis-based organization that promotes the stateÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s life sciences sector.  Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cAnd I think that, you know, given that model, and given the almost miraculous success of some of these drugs, I think [big drug companies] would be ludicrous not to try to get into this.Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½  Ã¢â\u201a¬ËœVery fast paceÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢  At Cardinal HealthÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s manufacturing center, about 5 miles west of Ascension St. VincentÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s flagship hospital at West 86th Street and Township Line Road, the company acts as a contract manufacturing organization to numerous pharmaceutical partners, turning out isotopes for Bayer, Novartis, Bristol Myers Squibb and others.  Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cSome of our pharmaceutical partners choose to do their own manufacturing, which is fine,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ said Mike Pintek, president of CardinalÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s nuclear and precision medicine. Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cBut they want to partner with us for preparation, dispensing and distribution of their drug to the patient.Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½  The company, based in Dublin, Ohio, rang up sales last year of $1.2 billion in its nuclear and precision health division, up 41%. That made it a fairly small player in the Cardinal Health empire, which had total revenue of $205 billion. But itÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s one of the fastest-growing divisions.  Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cWe are considered one of the key growth companies within Cardinal,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ Pintek said.  In an hourlong interview and tour at their Indianapolis plant, Cardinal officials played up their divisionÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s performance, pointing out that it delivers more than 12 million doses of medicine annually, with an on-time delivery rate of 99.8%.  The manufacturing space spans about 20,000 square feet, with room for ann additional 8,000 or so square feet of clean rooms. Officials took pains to point out the safety features, including numerous radioactivity monitors and plenty of thick lead shielding.  Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cYouÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢re looking at a hot cell with 10 inches thick of lead all the way around,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ Thrasher said, pointing to one area. Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cThis one big lead glass window alone is 14 inches deep, 1 ton apiece just in the windows alone.Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½  On this particular day, none of the clean rooms was in operation, and the manufacturing plant, with about 30 employees, seemed mostly empty.  But Thrasher said the company had been operating the rooms for various clients just a few days earlier and was busy setting up space for other clients. He said the lead time for accepting a new client that needs a new manufacturing space is about a year and a half.  Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cOn the days the room is not used for [a certain client], weÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢ll clean it, weÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢ll clear it, and weÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢ll release it for a different product and different client,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ he said.  Cardinal Health officials said the high demand for manufacturing space and radiopharmaceuticals means the industry is likely at its early stages and will only grow by leaps in the years ahead.  Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cI would say weÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢re still in the early days of precision medicine, but itÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s moving at a very fast pace,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ Pintek said. Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cAnd itÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s really exciting to see what it could mean for my children, their children and future generations.Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½Ã¢â\u201a¬Â¢",

    "article_text": "SEOUL, South Korea Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u20ac� North Korea on Saturday confirmed that it had test-fired a tactical ballistic missile, the government news agency KCNA reported, with leader Kim Jong Un vowing to boost the countryÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s nuclear force.  Kim oversaw the Friday test launch into the East Sea, also known as the Sea of Japan, on a mission to evaluate the Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201caccuracy and reliabilityÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ of a new autonomous navigation system, the KCNA report said.  ADVERTISEMENT  Kim expressed Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cgreat satisfactionÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ over the test.  The South Korean government reported the launch Friday, saying the North had fired multiple suspected short-range ballistic missiles.  READ: North Korea fires suspected missiles into ocean, Seoul says  Seoul described the event as Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cseveral flying objects presumed to be short-range ballistic missilesÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ from North KoreaÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s eastern Wonsan area into waters off its coast.  The missiles traveled around 300 kilometers (186 miles), the Joint Chiefs of Staff in Seoul said, adding that the military had Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cstrengthened vigilance and surveillance in preparation for additional launchesÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ and was sharing information with allies Washington and Tokyo.  The launch was the latest in a string of ever more sophisticated tests by North Korea, which has fired off cruise missiles, tactical rockets and hypersonic weapons in recent months, in what the nuclear-armed country says is a drive to upgrade its defenses.  Seoul and Washington have accused North Korea of sending arms to Russia, which would violate rafts of UN sanctions on both countries, with experts saying the recent spate of testing may be of weapons destined for use on battlefields in Ukraine.  ADVERTISEMENT  READ: Kim Jong UnÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s sister denies North Korea exporting weapons to Russia  The launches came hours after KimÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s sister Kim Yo Jong accused Seoul and Washington of Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cmisleading the public opinionÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ on the issue with their repeated accusations that Pyongyang is sending weapons to Moscow for use in Ukraine.

Speed  1.00 0.25  0.50  0.75  1.00  1.25  1.50  1.75  2.00  Cardinal HealthÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s Center for Theranostics in Indianapolis has about 20,000 square feet of clean-room manufacturing space, with room for about 8,000 square feet more. (Photo courtesy of Cardinal Health)  Inside a large manufacturing building on the northwest side of Indianapolis, officials at Cardinal Health are busy at work on their latest expansion project, yet another clean room for nuclear medicine.  Already, workers have erected massive walls of thick lead weighing hundreds of tons to shield technicians against radiation.  Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cThereÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s still one more layer [of lead] to go on,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ said Shane Thrasher, vice president of nuclear manufacturing. Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cThatÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s for the appropriate amount of radioactive shielding from whatÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s inside.Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½  WhatÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s inside, when the project is completed, will be large commercial batches of actinium 225, an isotope that can be infused into a patient in small doses with the goal of destroying or shrinking cancer cells with more precision than chemotherapy and with fewer side effects.  Already, Cardinal Health has spent more than $50 million in the past three years on the plant, named the Center for Theranostics (a combination of Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201ctherapeuticsÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cdiagnosticsÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½), to meet huge demand for nuclear medical products that are known as radiopharmaceuticals.  ItÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s a booming industry, with a large cluster in central Indiana. And the roster of players has surged in the past few years to include some of the worldÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s leading pharmaceutical companies, attracted by the potential for significant growth.  Companies as far away as France, Switzerland and Israel have invested billions of dollars in radiopharmaceutical manufacturing assets in central Indiana. They are attracted by the regionÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s central location, workforce talent and long history in pharmaceutical drug-making.  Last year, Indianapolis-based Eli Lilly and Co.Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u20ac�better known for its long history in insulins, antidepressants and traditional cancer drugsÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u20ac�jumped into the radiopharmaceutical business by buying Point Biopharma Global Inc., an Indianapolis-based startup, for $1.4 billion. Point had recently built a 77,000-square-foot manufacturing plant off Georgetown Road to develop radioactive compounds.  Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cWeÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢re really excited about bringing radiopharmaceuticals into the portfolio by way of the acquisition of Point Biopharma,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ Jacob Van Naarden, president of LillyÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s oncology business, said during an earnings conference call last month. Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cWe are supplementing that acquisition with additional work through our discovery labs and the ability to make these medicines ourselves.Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½  In April, Switzerland-based Novartis AG held an open house for its new, 70,000-square-foot manufacturing plant near the Indianapolis International Airport that cost $100 million. Just a few months earlier, federal regulators approved the facility to make Pluvicto, a radiopharmaceutical medication to treat advanced-stage prostate cancer.  Novartis acquired the rights to Pluvicto when it bought West Lafayette-based startup Endocyte Inc. for $2.1 billion in 2018. Last year, Pluvicto brought in $980 million in sales.  In February, New Jersey-based pharmaceutical giant Bristol Myers Squibb Co. jumped into the game when it acquired a San Diego startup, RayzeBio Inc., for $4.1 billion. The deal included a 64,000-square-foot manufacturing plant that RayzeBio renovated in Indianapolis to make isotopes for targeted therapy of gastroenteropancreatic and neuroendocrine tumors.  In Westfield, an Israel-based company, Isotopia, is building 28,000 square feet of clean rooms, labs and other space at a cost of $20 million. The companyÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s first U.S. facility will make radioactive medical isotopes for targeted cancer treatments.  And two years ago, Australia-based Telix Pharmaceuticals, with U.S. headquarters in Fishers, dosed its first patient with a new imaging agent designed to target and light up prostate cancer cells so doctors can see them. Last year alone, the drug, known as Illuccix, rang up more than $500 million in sales.  At the crossroads  Central Indiana is emerging as perhaps the largest nuclear medicine cluster in the United States, due to a wide mix of factors that include the regionÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s central location, which allows products to be shipped quickly across the nation. ThatÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s critical for radiopharmaceuticals, which begin to decay immediately after being manufactured and have an extremely short shelf life. Unlike most pills, radiopharmaceuticals often last less than a week or two and need to be shipped to hospitals and clinics just-in-time for use.  IndianaÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s central location, coupled with an airport that houses the second-largest FedEx hub in the world, is a tough combination to beat, officials say.  And then thereÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s Purdue University, about an hour northwest of Indianapolis, which houses the nationÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s oldest and largest nuclear pharmacy program. The program, set up in the 1970s, trains not only pharmacists but also nuclear medicine technicians, radiation safety officers and other professionals in the nuclear industry.  The industry is growing, among other reasons, because researchers have been better able to develop drugs, called ligands, that act like self-guided missiles and seek out cancer cells based on certain biomarkers that are unique to cancer.  After being infused, the ligands are metabolized into the bloodstream and rapidly begin traveling throughout the body, binding to cancer cells.  In the process, they carry a radioisotope that acts like a nuclear warhead on a missile. But instead of exploding, the radioisotope decays, releasing particles that cause damage to the cancer cellÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s DNA, destroying the cell.  Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cIf you look at some of the early results, this is just another treatment option for patients with cancer,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ said Kara Weatherman, a Purdue clinical professor of pharmacy who leads the schoolÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s nuclear pharmacy program. Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cChemotherapy, obviously, has some significant negative aspects of treating. And so, I think as the population gets older, as the incidence of cancer goes up, having multiple options for treatment is very logical.Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½  Buying technology  Todd Hockemeyer, CEO of IsotopiaÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s U.S. operations, said he isnÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢t surprised that large pharmaceutical companies are scooping up radiopharmaceutical startups and their Indiana manufacturing assets.  Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cI think the industry is waking up to the fact that radiotherapeutics is another arrow in the quiver,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ he told IBJ. Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cIf youÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢re in the oncology marketplace, this is something thatÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s got to be in your portfolio.Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½  Hockemeyer, who previously built a factory in Indianapolis for Point Biopharma, said the radiopharmaceutical industry has specialized knowledge that is very different from that of traditional pharmaceutical players. As a result, those traditional companies are more likely to buy or partner with smaller companies that have developed highly promising drugs or manufacturing assets.  Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cI think they realized that, Ã¢â\u201a¬ËœLook, this would be very difficult for us to organically dig this out of the ground. So letÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s go buy something,Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ Hockemeyer said.  Even large nuclear medicine companies are joining the shopping spree. In 2020, Curium, a nuclear medicine company with headquarters in London and Paris, purchased Zevacor Molecular, one of the first radiopharmaceuticals players in central Indiana, which had built a $10 million plant in Noblesville. Curium said it would invest another $10 million at the site.  Mike Bolinder, a former Lilly executive, said the industry research and development model has shifted in the past decade or so from trying to develop all drugs in-house to working with startups that do the intensive early work of raising venture capital and developing products.  Then, if something pans out, the large pharmaceutical companies can try to buy or license the product and add it to their pipeline, said Bolinder, who is now senior vice president at BioCrossroads, an Indianapolis-based organization that promotes the stateÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s life sciences sector.  Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cAnd I think that, you know, given that model, and given the almost miraculous success of some of these drugs, I think [big drug companies] would be ludicrous not to try to get into this.Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½  Ã¢â\u201a¬ËœVery fast paceÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢  At Cardinal HealthÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s manufacturing center, about 5 miles west of Ascension St. VincentÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s flagship hospital at West 86th Street and Township Line Road, the company acts as a contract manufacturing organization to numerous pharmaceutical partners, turning out isotopes for Bayer, Novartis, Bristol Myers Squibb and others.  Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cSome of our pharmaceutical partners choose to do their own manufacturing, which is fine,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ said Mike Pintek, president of CardinalÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s nuclear and precision medicine. Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cBut they want to partner with us for preparation, dispensing and distribution of their drug to the patient.Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½  The company, based in Dublin, Ohio, rang up sales last year of $1.2 billion in its nuclear and precision health division, up 41%. That made it a fairly small player in the Cardinal Health empire, which had total revenue of $205 billion. But itÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s one of the fastest-growing divisions.  Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cWe are considered one of the key growth companies within Cardinal,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ Pintek said.  In an hourlong interview and tour at their Indianapolis plant, Cardinal officials played up their divisionÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s performance, pointing out that it delivers more than 12 million doses of medicine annually, with an on-time delivery rate of 99.8%.  The manufacturing space spans about 20,000 square feet, with room for ann additional 8,000 or so square feet of clean rooms. Officials took pains to point out the safety features, including numerous radioactivity monitors and plenty of thick lead shielding.  Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cYouÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢re looking at a hot cell with 10 inches thick of lead all the way around,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ Thrasher said, pointing to one area. Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cThis one big lead glass window alone is 14 inches deep, 1 ton apiece just in the windows alone.Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½  On this particular day, none of the clean rooms was in operation, and the manufacturing plant, with about 30 employees, seemed mostly empty.  But Thrasher said the company had been operating the rooms for various clients just a few days earlier and was busy setting up space for other clients. He said the lead time for accepting a new client that needs a new manufacturing space is about a year and a half.  Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cOn the days the room is not used for [a certain client], weÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢ll clean it, weÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢ll clear it, and weÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢ll release it for a different product and different client,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ he said.  Cardinal Health officials said the high demand for manufacturing space and radiopharmaceuticals means the industry is likely at its early stages and will only grow by leaps in the years ahead.  Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cI would say weÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢re still in the early days of precision medicine, but itÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s moving at a very fast pace,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ Pintek said. Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cAnd itÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s really exciting to see what it could mean for my children, their children and future generations.Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½  Story Continues Below",

    "article_text": "On this day in 1974, India conducted its landmark first nuclear tests in Pokhran, Rajasthan, as part of the Ã¢â\u201a¬ËœSmiling BuddhaÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢ operation. Until it actually happened, secrecy surrounded the event, as many major world powers at the time attempted to restrict the proliferation of states with nuclear weapons.  Then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi termed the event a Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cpeaceful nuclear explosionÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½, perhaps to assuage the rest of the world and particularly the members of the United Nations Security CouncilÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s permanent five (or P-5) members: the United States, the United Kingdom, France, China and Russia. What exactly was their opposition, and what was IndiaÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s aim behind the test? We explain.  What was the background to India conducting its nuclear tests?  Following the end of World War II in 1945, which led to the deaths of millions and unprecedented destruction, new global alliances and alignments emerged. The US and the USSR continued engaging in proxy wars in other countries, for ideological and economic superiority, in what was dubbed the Cold War.  Advertisement  With the US dropping two nuclear bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki towards the end of the war in August 1945, and the Soviet Union carrying out its own nuclear test in 1949, it was decided that certain regulations were required to prevent massive devastation at the hands of nuclear weapons.  To maintain a kind of minimal peace, one such treaty was signed in 1968, called the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT). Nuclear-weapon States parties under the NPT are defined as those that manufactured and exploded a nuclear weapon or other nuclear explosive devices before January 1, 1967, effectively meaning the P-5 countries.  Prime Minister Indira Gandhi visits the site of the nuclear explosion at Pokhran in Rajasthan in 1974. (Express archive photo) Prime Minister Indira Gandhi visits the site of the nuclear explosion at Pokhran in Rajasthan in 1974. (Express archive photo)  Firstly, its signatories agreed not to transfer either nuclear weapons or nuclear weapons technology to any other state. Second, the non-nuclear states agreed that they would not receive, develop or otherwise acquire nuclear weapons.  All of the signatories agreed to submit to the safeguards against proliferation established by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Parties to the treaty also agreed to help end the nuclear arms race and limit the spread of the technology.  Advertisement  Why did India choose to conduct nuclear tests?  India objected to this treaty on the grounds that it was discriminatory to countries except the P-5. As foreign policy researcher Sumit Ganguly wrote, Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cThe government of India refused to accede to the terms of the treaty because it failed to address IndiaÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s misgivingsÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½, specifically, the fact that non-nuclear statesÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢ pledge to not develop such weapons was not linked to any such definite obligation on part of the states already possessing nuclear weapons.  Opinion | Why India went nuclear 25 years ago  Domestically, Indian scientists Homi J Bhabha and Vikram Sarabhai had laid the groundwork earlier for nuclear energy to be tested in India. In 1954, the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) was founded, with Bhabha as director.  An early proponent of nuclear energy, Bhabha once wrote, Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cMoreover, when nuclear energy has been successfully applied for power production in say a couple of decades from now, India will not have to look abroad for its experts but will find them ready at hand.Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ But Prime Minister Jawahar Lal Nehru continued being skeptical of nuclear weapons and expanding arms acquisition in general.  A change of leadership in the 1960s (with the death of PM Nehru and his successor Morarji Desai), a war with China in 1962 that India lost, and wars with Pakistan in 1965 and 1971, both won by India, changed the direction of IndiaÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s plans. China also conducted its nuclear tests in 1964.  Advertisement  How did Pokhran-I happen?  Unlike Nehru, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi did not hold a negative view of nuclear tests. But given the treaties that the P-5 had in place, India decided to conduct its tests without any prior information being released to the world.  There was uncertainty even till the end, according to an account detailed by political commentator Inder Malhotra in The Indian Express. Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cRaja Ramanna, the mastermind of the venture [Atomic Energy Commission Chairman], two of Indira GandhiÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s top advisers, PN Haksar and PN Dhar, were opposed to it, and wanted it postponed. Homi Sethna, chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, offered no opinion. D Nag Chaudhuri, Scientific Adviser to the Defence Minister, started weighing pros and cons but was cut short by the prime minister. Ã¢â\u201a¬ËœDr. Ramanna,Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢ she said, turning to him, Ã¢â\u201a¬Ëœplease go ahead. It would be good for the countryÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢. The next morning, the Buddha smiled,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ he wrote.  A nuclear device was detonated, with a yield of 12-13 kiloton of TNT, on May 18, 1974. Pokhran, an army test range located in the desert of western Rajasthan, was chosen. A team of around 75 researchers and scientists were involved. Its code name came from the testÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s date being on the same day as Buddha Jayanti, the birth date of Gautam Buddha.  And what happened after the tests?  India demonstrated to the world that it could defend itself in an extreme situation and chose not to immediately weaponise the nuclear device it tested at Pokhran. This was to happen only after 1998Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s Pokhran-II tests.  Advertisement  But before that, it would face significant criticism from many countries.  In 1978, US President Jimmy Carter signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act, following which the US ceased exporting nuclear assistance to India. The US view on India testing such technologies would only shift on July 18, 2005, when US President George W Bush and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh first announced their intention to enter into a nuclear agreement in Washington.  The US also pushed for setting up a club of nuclear equipment and fissile material suppliers. The 48-nation Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) would go on to implement agreed rules for exporting nuclear equipment, with a view to controlling the spread of nuclear weapons and where members would be admitted only by consensus.  India has been trying, since 2008, to join the group, which would give it a place at the high table where the rules of nuclear commerce are decided Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u20ac� and, eventually, the ability to sell equipment. Many countries that initially opposed its entry, like Australia, have changed stance; Mexico and Switzerland are the latest to voice support. IndiaÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s effort has been to chip away at the resistance, leaving only one holdout Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u20ac� China.  Advertisement  This was one reason as to why India did not immediately go for the next step, that of the testing a nuclear bomb, doing so only in 1998. Then too, the international reaction was critical, but over the years India has projected itself as a Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cresponsibleÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ owner of these weapons, allowing acceptance among countries and into groups like the NSG.

While visiting an arms factory on Friday, Kim made the production order \"to cope with ...the enemies' reckless military confrontation\" and bolster nuclear war deterrence, KCNA said.  This way, the enemy would be afraid of North Korea's nuclear combat posture, Kim added.  North Korea fired a number of short-range ballistic missiles towards the sea off its east coast on Friday, South Korea's military had said. Kim expressed satisfaction with the successful missile test featuring an autonomous navigation system, KCNA said.  Friday's launches came a day after the U.S. and South Korea conducted joint drills with stealth fighter jets simulating air combat.",

    "article_text": "KYODO NEWS - 2 hours ago - 08:10 | All, World  The United States conducted a subcritical nuclear test on Tuesday, the first since September 2021, a government agency said, in an apparent effort to bolster deterrence against countries such as China and Russia.  The experiment, the third under the administration of President Joe Biden, was carried out in Nevada to collect \"essential data\" regarding the country's nuclear warheads, according to the National Nuclear Security Administration.  Although China and Russia, as well as Iran and North Korea, continue to expand their nuclear capabilities, the test is likely to trigger criticism as running counter to disarmament hopes in places such as Hiroshima, a Japanese city that was devastated by a U.S. atomic bomb during World War II.  The NNSA, an arm of the U.S. Energy Department, said in a statement issued Thursday that it \"relies on subcritical experiments to collect valuable information to support the safety, security, reliability and effectiveness of America's nuclear warheads, without the use of nuclear explosive testing.\"  It said the experiment was executed Tuesday evening in the Principal Underground Laboratory for Subcritical Experimentation facility at the Nevada National Security Site.  The United States suspended underground nuclear tests in 1992 and began subcritical nuclear tests five years later.  As subcritical nuclear tests do not result in a nuclear explosion, the United States has asserted that they are not prohibited under the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, which the country has signed but not ratified.  The NNSA also said the latest test, which brought the total number of U.S. subcritical tests to 34, did not form a self-sustaining, supercritical chain reaction and was therefore consistent with the country's self-imposed moratorium on nuclear testing in place since 1992.  Tuesday's test was the first in the \"Nimble series,\" carried out with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the NNSA said, adding it will continue the new cycle of experiments also with support from Los Alamos National Laboratory.  \"We plan to increase the frequency of these subcritical experiments so we can continue to gather important data on nuclear weapons materials, with no technical need for a return to underground nuclear explosive testing,\" Marvin Adams, deputy administrator for the agency's defense programs, said in the statement.  Three rounds of subcritical nuclear tests were conducted under the administration of Biden's predecessor Donald Trump and four rounds under the Barack Obama administration.

    "article_text": "In Nuclear Is Not the Solution (Verso, July), global affairs scholar M.V. Ramana explains the dangers of atomic energy and why it wonÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢t save the planet.  Why move away from atomic power?  Advocates for nuclear power claim that we should expand it to solve  climate change, but itÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s not possible  to do fast enough to keep global temperatures under 1.5 Ã\u201aÂ°C because nuclear reactors take a long time to build. Nuclear is also far more expensive than modern renewables like solar and wind energy, the infrastructure for which is also easier to make than nuclear plants. Expanding nuclear energy will result in money and time being diverted from more effective ways to lower emissions. At the same time, expanding nuclear energy will create greater potential for the continued maintenance of nuclear weapons arsenals while enabling new countries to acquire them.  Why do you think nuclear power gained such traction in the environmental movement?  Over the last couple of decades, powerful groups benefiting from the current inequitable distribution of resources and power have promoted nuclear energy to deal with environmental problems because they want people to believe that it is possible to avoid the dire consequences of large-scale climate change while preserving the current economic system. In parallel, the news on the climate front has become increasingly dire, and people are prone to wishful thinking and susceptible to propaganda about nuclear technology preventing the situation from escalating further.  You argue that corporate interests downplay legitimate safety concerns surrounding nuclear energy. Can you elaborate on that?  Many nuclear energy advocates deny that accidents are possible, and then deny that accidents are harmful by rejecting the well-documented health impacts associated with radiation exposure. This is effective because accidents are rare and the symptoms of radiation exposure can resemble other ailments, making their cause difficult to prove. ItÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s easy to introduce an element of doubt. The primary strategy that could help counteract such propaganda is to clearly and repeatedly explain why radiation is bad for health and that there is no escaping that reality.  How has the conversation around nuclear power evolved over the past several decades?  In comparison to earlier debates, the current set of arguments tends to focus more on climate change. Advocates are quick to assert that nuclear reactors are the solution to any and every problem. TheyÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢re like the proverbial person with a hammer who perceives everything as a nail. The latest such argument for nuclear plants is the need for energy to power computers used for artificial intelligence or producing cryptocurrencies.",

    "article_text": "Fifty years ago, India conducted its first nuclear test in Pokhran, code-named Operation Smiling Buddha. With this India had entered the league of nations with nuclear capabilities.  An article dated May 19th, 1974, says India successfully conducted an underground test with plutonium device in 10-15 kiloton range. It also adds that the then Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission Dr H.N Sethna and Director of The Bhabha Atomic Research Centre DR R Ramanna, who supervised the test, flew to Delhi even without a wash or change to give a full account to Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.  India said that it undertook this programme to develop its own technology for peaceful use of nuclear energy and it had no intention of going in for nuclear weapons. The groundwork for testing nuclear energy was laid even earlier by renowned Indian scientists Homi J Bhabha and Vikram Sarabhai. In 1954, the Department of Atomic Energy was founded, with Bhabha as director.  With Smiling Buddha, India became the first nation to conduct a nuclear test apart from the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council. After the nuclear test, there were criticisms that it was an attempt to divert peopleÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s attention from the economic crisis the country was facing in the 1970s.  However, the Atomic Energy Commission chairman said that it was his decision and that there was no political motive, Even a New York Times article said that Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201csuch great talent of resources has been squandered on the vanity of power, while 600 million Indians slip deeper into povertyÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½.  India also faced significant criticism from many countries including Pakistan, USA, and Canada. Pakistan said that it would never succumb to Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cnuclear blackmailÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ or accept Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cIndian hegemony or domination over the subcontinentÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½.  India did not carry out further nuclear tests until 1998. In 1998, under the leadership of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, India conducted a series of nuclear tests in Pokhran once again, code-named Operation Shakti.  With this, India declared itself a full-fledged nuclear state.  Script and production: Gayatri Menon  Research: Gayatri Menon and Murali Krishnaswamy  Archive photo courtesy: M.

The US Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration says the test took place on Tuesday in the western state of Nevada.  The NNSA said it relies on subcritical tests to support the safety and effectiveness of nuclear warheads.  The US government announced a moratorium on tests involving nuclear explosions in 1992. But successive administrations have continued subcritical tests.  The previous subcritical test took place in September 2021.  The US has not ratified the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, but an NNSA official said the 33 previous subcritical experiments and the latest experiment were consistent with the stipulated zero-yield standard.  A senior official of the NNSA said, \"We plan to increase the frequency of these subcritical experiments so we can continue to gather important data on nuclear weapons materials, with no technical need for a return to underground nuclear explosive testing.\"",

The state-run Korean Central Television said on Saturday that the country's Missile Administration carried out the test-launch in waters off the eastern coast of the Korean Peninsula. The report said North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un oversaw it. A released photo shows a missile reportedly striking its target.  North Korea has been developing tactical ballistic missiles, which the North says are designed to carry nuclear warheads. Observers say the missiles could be used in potential attacks on South Korean and US military bases in South Korea.  On Friday, Kim said North Korea's enemies would be afraid of playing with fire when they witness its \"nuclear combat posture.\" He made the remark when he visited a defense industrial complex. He also stressed the need to accelerate activities for bolstering the country's \"nuclear force.\"  The South Korean military said North Korea launched what appeared to be multiple short-range ballistic missiles toward waters off the eastern coast on Friday afternoon.",

    "article_text": "By Song Sang-ho  WASHINGTON, May 17 (Yonhap) -- South Korean and U.S. officials have stressed the need to address an \"inextricable\" link between North Korea's human rights and security issues, claiming Pyongyang's repressive political climate has led it to divert its scarce resources to its weapons programs without public pushback.  The Committee for Human Rights in North Korea (HRNK), a U.S.-based nongovernmental institute, issued a report Friday to further substantiate the claim as it sheds light on how the reclusive regime has utilized its nuclear scientists and engineers to maintain and advance its sprawling nuclear program.  Casting the North's nuclear science personnel as \"slaves to the bomb,\" the report delves into the human rights context of the North's nuclear program -- an aspect eclipsed in part by North Korean media highlighting the ostensible loyalty and devotions of the regime's scientists and related workers. Robert Collins, a senior HRNK advisor, authored it.  \"Along with our South Korean counterparts, we've been very outspoken over the past few years in our belief that the DPRK human rights issues and the DPRK security issues are inextricably linked,\" U.S. Special Envoy for North Korean Human Rights Issues Julie Turner said at a HRNK event on the report's publication.  DPRK stands for the North's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.  \"It's the DPRK's repressive political climate that allows the government to divert such a large share of its budget and resources to weapons without comment from the population, which continues to suffer from severe economic hardships and malnutrition,\" she added.    U.S. Special Envoy for North Korean Human Rights Issues Julie Turner speaks about a report on the human rights situation of North Korean nuclear scientists released by the Committee for Human Rights in North Korea (HRNK), a U.S.-based nongovernmental institute, during an event in Washington on May 17, 2024. (Yonhap)  The report focuses on the predicament of the North's nuclear scientists, engineers and workers who work at nuclear laboratories, uranium mines, nuclear testing sites and other related installations. Citing a 2010 estimate, it put the total number of the North's nuclear-related personnel at 6,000.  It underscores that the nuclear workers are compelled \"from grade school until the end of their lives\" to serve the regime's nuclear program \"in any way they are directed.\"  \"This includes studying nuclear program-related subjects, living where they are told, marrying who they are told, eating what they are provided, confessing weekly to their shortcomings relative to regime ideology and workplace performance, working in unsafe conditions,\" it said.  It also debunks the speculation that nuclear scientists and engineers hold a prestigious place in North Korean society due to their skills and contributions.  \"That is not the case,\" it said. \"As such, the treatment of Kim's 'slaves to the bomb' reflects the rigid structure of the North Korean regime and constitutes violations of international human rights law.\"  Meanwhile, Turner underscored the United States' commitment to addressing human rights concerns, including about the North's labor practices involving workers at home and abroad, through sanctions, import restrictions, business advisories and other tools.  \"We will shine a light on the DPRK source of labor practices both within its borders and among the workers it sends abroad to labor in mining, logging, seafood processing, information technology and other industries,\" she said.    This photo shows the cover of a report on the human rights situation of North Korean nuclear scientists released by the Committee for Human Rights in North Korea (HRNK), a U.S.-based nongovernmental institute.

This directive coincided with his oversight of a test involving tactical ballistic missiles equipped with a new guidance system, state media KCNA said on Saturday.  Kim made the production order Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cto cope with Ã¢â\u201a¬Â¦the enemiesÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢ reckless military confrontationÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ and bolster nuclear war deterrence while visiting an arms factory on Friday, KCNA said.  Kim said that the enemy would be afraid of North KoreaÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s nuclear combat posture after speeding up production of nuclear weapons, according to reports.  Advertisement  North Korea fired multiple short-range ballistic missiles into the sea off its east coast on Friday, according to South KoreaÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s military. This launch came a day after the US and South Korea conducted joint air combat drills with stealth fighter jets. In recent months, North Korea has launched various ballistic and cruise missiles as well as tactical rockets, claiming these actions are part of an effort to enhance its defensive capabilities.  North Korean leader Kim Jong Un recently oversaw the testing of 600 mm Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201csuper-largeÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ multiple rocket launchers and 240 mm multiple launch rockets, and he visited production facilities, as reported by state media. Tensions on the Korean peninsula have escalated since the North scrapped a 2018 pact aimed at reducing hostilities near the military border established under the truce that ended the 1950-53 Korean War, subsequently labeling the South as Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cenemy No. 1.Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½  Earlier on Friday, Kim Yo Jong, the powerful sister of North KoreaÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s leader, stated that their tactical weapons are solely intended as a deterrent against South Korean military aggression, while also denying that Pyongyang is exporting weapons. U.S. and South Korean officials have accused North Korea of shipping weapons to Russia to help replenish its stocks for the war against Ukraine, an accusation both Moscow and Pyongyang have denied.  FridayÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s launches came a day after the U.S. and South Korea conducted joint drills with stealth fighter jets simulating air combat.  With inputs from agencies.",

    "article_text": "North Korea has test-fired a tactical ballistic missile equipped with a \"new autonomous navigation system\", state media said Saturday, with leader Kim Jong Un vowing to boost the country's nuclear force.  In this photo provided by the North Korean government, the country's leader Kim Jong Un, second left, visits a defence industrial complex at an undisclosed place in North Korea on May 17, 2024.  Advertising Read more  Kim oversaw the Friday test-launch into the East Sea, also known as the Sea of Japan, on a mission to evaluate the \"accuracy and reliability of the autonomous navigation system\", Pyongyang's official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said.  The launch was the latest in a string of ever more sophisticated tests by North Korea, which has fired off cruise missiles, tactical rockets and hypersonic weapons in recent months, in what the nuclear-armed, UN-sanctioned country says is a drive to upgrade its defences.  The Friday launch came hours after leader Kim's powerful sister Kim Yo Jong denied allegations by Seoul and Washington that Pyongyang is shipping weapons to Russia for use in its war in Ukraine.  Seoul's military on Friday described the test as \"several flying objects presumed to be short-range ballistic missiles\" from North Korea's eastern Wonsan area into waters off its coast.  The suspected missiles travelled around 300 kilometres (186 miles) before splashing down in waters between South Korea and Japan, the Joint Chiefs of Staff in Seoul said.  \"The accuracy and reliability of the autonomous navigation system were verified through the test fire,\" Pyongyang's KCNA said Saturday, adding leader Kim expressed \"great satisfaction\" over the launch.  In a separate report released on Saturday, KCNA said Kim visited a military production facility the previous day and urged for \"more rapidly bolstering the nuclear force\" of the nation \"without halt and hesitation\".  During the visit, he said the \"enemies would be afraid of and dare not to play with fire only when they witness the nuclear combat posture of our state\", according to KCNA.  Pyongyang's nuclear force \"will meet a very important change and occupy a remarkably raised strategic position\" when its munitions production plan, aimed to be completed by 2025, is carried out, it added.  Putin's attention  Seoul and Washington have accused North Korea of sending arms to Russia, which would violate rafts of United Nations sanctions on both countries, with experts saying the recent spate of testing may be of weapons destined for use on battlefields in Ukraine.  North Korea is barred by UN sanctions from any tests using ballistic technology, but its key ally Moscow used its UN Security Council veto in March to effectively end UN monitoring of violations, for which Pyongyang has specifically thanked Russia.  But leader Kim's sister Kim Yo Jong said Friday that Pyongyang had \"no intention to export our military technical capabilities to any country\", adding that the North's priority was \"to make the war readiness and war deterrent of our army more perfect in quality and quantity\".  She accused Seoul and Washington of \"misleading the public opinion\" with their allegations that Pyongyang was transferring arms to Russia.  The Friday launches come as Russian leader Vladimir Putin was in China on Friday, the final day of a visit aiming to promote crucial trade with Beijing -- North Korea's most important ally -- and win greater support for his war effort in Ukraine.  North Korea's latest weapons tests were likely intended to attract the attention of Putin while he was in China, said Ahn Chan-il, a defector-turned-researcher who runs the World Institute for North Korea Studies.  The North would benefit greatly from an expected visit by Putin to Pyongyang, and \"they want their country to be used as a military logistics base during Russia's ongoing war (in Ukraine)\", he told AFP.  Yang Moo-jin, president of the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul, said: \"China and Russia's irresponsible handling of North Korea, riding on the new Cold War dynamics, is further encouraging Pyongyang's nuclear armament.\"  Inter-Korean relations are at one of their lowest points in years, with Pyongyang declaring Seoul its \"principal enemy\".  It has jettisoned agencies dedicated to reunification and threatened war over \"even 0.001 mm\" of territorial infringement.

    "article_text": "Today, May 18, 2024, marks the fiftieth anniversary of IndiaÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s peaceful nuclear explosion or PNE. To mark the occasion, the Toynbee Prize Foundation facilitated a conversation between historian Jayita Sarkar and myself. Dr. Sarkar explained what the PNE was and how it shaped Indian and nuclear history. In addition to the PNE, Dr. Sarkar and I also spoke about her acclaimed 2022 book, Ploughshares and Swords: IndiaÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s Nuclear Program in the Global Cold War which received the Bernard S. Cohn Book Prize from the Association for Asian Studies and Honorable Mention for Global Development Studies Book Award from the International Studies Association. The book can be freely read through its publisher, Cornell University Press, and here is a link to read my January 2023 Toynbee review of Ploughshares and Swords. Below is an edited version of our conversation.  Marc Reyes, University of Connecticut  Dr. Jayita Sarkar, author of Ploughshares and Swords: IndiaÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s Nuclear Program in the Global Cold War (2022)  MR: On May 18, 1974, India conducted what it called a Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cpeaceful nuclear explosionÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ or PNE. For those unfamiliar with the term or the incident, what was it and its significance to Indian history and nuclear history?  JS: Fifty years ago, the Indian government led by Indira Gandhi conducted an underground nuclear explosion in Pokhran, Rajasthan, part of the Thar desert in the countryÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s northwestern region. It was a plutonium implosion device of the kind dropped on Nagasaki, Japan on August 9, 1945. Immediately after the explosion in Pokhran, the Gandhi government called it an experiment to explore the uses of underground nuclear explosions for civilian purposes, such as for mining and oil drilling.  The Pokhran explosion coincided with the Global South countriesÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢ demands for greater economic equality in the form of a New International Economic Order or NIEO. The Indian government itself was a vocal advocate for NIEO, publicly invoking disparities between the developed and developing worlds as a significant issue on multilateral fora. The official ascription of peaceful uses made the Indian nuclear explosion a rhetorical device for economic decolonization against the backdrop of the 1973 oil shock and NIEO.  Nuclear explosion projects for civilian purposes had been underway in the United States and Soviet Union for decades prior, making Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cpeaceful nuclear explosionÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ or PNE a familiar term within policy circles. Multilateral studies on PNEs had circulated at the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency throughout the early 1970s. However, India was the first country that conducted its very first nuclear explosion underground and formally claimed that the explosion was to serve civilian purposes, thereby raising questions whether India had developed nuclear weapons instead. This was because technologically speaking, there was no distinction between a nuclear device used for creating harbors (as attempted in the United States) or lakes (as done by the Soviet Union) from that used as a bomb. Moreover, the nuclear explosions of the first five countries (United States, Soviet Union, United Kingdom, France, and China) that had conducted nuclear explosions before were aboveground, and none of them called theirs a PNE.  MR: After India tested its PNE, what were the domestic and international ramifications? Was it popular at home? Did other countries support or oppose it?  JS: The meaning-making of the 1974 Indian nuclear explosion was a Rorschach test: it was an inkblot that revealed more about the observers than what was being observed. It was a plutonium implosion device that was officially 12 kilotons in yield, measured 5.0 on the Richter scale, and made a crater 47 meters in radius and 10 meters in depth. Given its intrinsic ambiguity, the explosion meant different things to different audiences. Its significations were polyvalent. Naturally, the responses were multifaceted, both at home and abroad.  Nonproliferation hawks and IndiaÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s geopolitical adversaries saw the explosion unmistakably as a bomb. Modernization theory advocates considered it to be a prestige-driven demonstration by an impoverished country that had yet to take off: a paper tiger with no teeth and barely a meow. Actors who wanted to keep the option open to develop nuclear weapons by procuring technologies from multiple partners, saw a model to emulate. The ambiguity of the May 1974 nuclear explosion was not lost on domestic audiences. T.K. Mahadevan captured the explosionÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s heterogenous implications, when he wrote in the Times of India: Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cThe bomb, like beauty, is in the eye of the beholder. If you are a hawk, you will know it is a bomb. If you are a dove, you will pretend it is a device.Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½  Against the backdrop of an economic crisis exacerbated by the oil shock and social turmoil including railway strikes, the nebulousness of the nuclear explosionÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s meaning allowed the Gandhi government to get away with it. The prime minister publicly reassured audiences at home and abroad that no additional expenses were incurred for the nuclear explosion. Legality was also a key dimension of the nuclear explosion. Nuclear explosions were only permitted underground under the 1964 Partial or Limited Test Ban Treaty, to which India was a signatory. I explore legality more fully in my book in relation to other treaties, export control mechanisms, and domestic transformations within India, especially the Emergency (1975-1977).  Cover of Dr. Sarkar's 2022 book.  MR: In your bookÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s epilogue, Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cThe Anti-Dissent Machine,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ you write, Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cFreedom of action of the leaders of IndiaÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s nuclear program has transformed it into an anti-dissent machineÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ (p.203). Can further elaborate on how IndiaÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s nuclear program has altered, even stifled, dissent in India? Do you think national security projects, like nuclear weapons, fundamentally challenge or alter the democratic values of nations?  JS: National security projects can and do undermine democracy in the name of survival of the state, but so can development projects. The multifarious nature of IndiaÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s nuclear program meant that it served several interests of those at its helm: it was both a national security project as well as an endeavor for economic modernity. It was a vast infrastructure project that involved everything from mining and milling to reactors and reprocessing to space launch sites (the space and nuclear programs were closely aligned as I show in the book). In other words, the nuclear program was a manifestation of both the national security state as well as the developmental state.  When one reflects on what the implications were of this heterogeneous program in terms of accountability, one can see how it functioned as an anti-dissent machine. Opposing the nuclear program, was opposing modernity and survival, and thus was opposing the nation itself. One of the clearest instances were when in 2012 thousands of protestors at the Kudankulam nuclear power plant (in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu) were arrested and charged with sedition by the government, who called the demonstrators Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cenemies of the state.Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½  The anti-dissent machine of the nuclear program was the flipside of freedom of action. Different actors within the nuclear program had different priorities. Not only did freedom of action expand choices of those actors, but it also kept oversight at bayÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u20ac� at home and abroadÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u20ac� for the pursuit of different goals of the various actors. For instance, Vikram Sarabhai and Satish Dhawan, who led IndiaÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s space program at different moments, prioritized protecting the space program from outside interference and thus kept the space program at armÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s length from the nuclear program and defense laboratories. The Indian Planning CommissionÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s attempted oversight of the Department of Atomic EnergyÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s budget and projects encouraged Sarabhai and technocrats like M.A. Vellodi to maintain a host of projects that concurrently served civilian and military aims. So, the programÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s polyvalence in practice undermined oversight and accountability.  MR: I am always curious about what was left on the cutting room floor. How did your book differ from your dissertation? Was there material from the dissertation that did not make it into the book? As one project became another, what didnÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢t make the final draft? WhatÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s a document or source that you found during your research but just havenÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢t been able to use yet or find a home for?  JS: This is such a fun question to answer. I was over the word count for my book manuscript by nearly 12,000 words. So, almost a chapter's worth of prose did not enter the final version of the book manuscript prior to copyediting. Since the bookÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s publication, some readers have politely complained to me that the last chapter, Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cExplosion and Fallout,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ felt a bit rushed and that I could have added more texture to it. I do not disagree with them, but the backstory was going over the wordcount.  In terms of the book-to-the-dissertation process, I conducted fresh archival research in several countries, found new digitized collections to use, had some wonderful colleagues share their own primary source materials with me, spent months thinking about the structure of the book, its overarching arguments and contributions, and shared drafts for comments from colleagues and friends who inhabited different historiographical worlds, from political and diplomatic history to history of science and technology to histories of decolonization. In other words, there was a lot of deep reflection and reformulation over several years that made the book what it became.  I did not wish to rush the book. So, right after the PhD, I began working on my second book project while letting ideas percolate about redrafting Ploughshares and Swords. Fortunately, I had the privilege of time and resources through a string of postdoctoral fellowships, research grants, and a tenure-track position to be able to do so.  As I had to leave sections out of the book, I was sad that primary source materials about the nuclear black-market from the Swiss Federal Archives could not enter the book. Several of those were police reports providing Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cthick descriptionsÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ of smugglers and smuggling networks operating along the Swiss borders with France and West Germany: the European leg of what would become known as the infamous A.Q. Khan network of global nuclear smuggling from the 1980s to 2000s. Some of those materials were intriguing, showing palpably the fluidity of borderlands in Western Europe and the connections between territoriality and technopolitics, which as you know, are the two through-threads of my book.

MR: From my count, you conducted research at twenty-two archives in eight countries. For your study of IndiaÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s nuclear program, did you have a favorite archive?  JS: For the book, I conducted archival research from 2010 until 2018 while also delving into several rich digitized collections during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Each archive came with its own set of opportunities and challenges, some more impervious than others. Archives in India and France probably had the same level of bureaucracy, opacity, and uncertainty when it came to access. The smoothest experiences were unsurprisingly in the United Kingdom, Canada, Switzerland, and US presidential libraries. My favorites are where archivists tirelessly work in dusty spaces, cataloging materials, promptly answering researchersÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢ questions, making materials available, and going over the rules of the research room with big smiles on their faces. Without archivists, there would be no history.  Archive snapshot: Letter from Prime Minister Indira Gandhi to the Chogyal of Sikkim, December 4, 1971, SPA/FA/IN/013, EAP880/1/2/24.

JS: The challenges and opportunities of writing this kind of history is an important point of discussion. Let me divide my comments into two: one is archives, and the other is exceptionalism.  Here, I think it is important to first reflect briefly on the state of the field of the twentieth-century history of South Asia. Over the past two decades, owing to declassification of national, international, local, and private archives concerning the period after the formal decolonization of South Asia (1947Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u20acœ48), subject matters that were once the turf of journalists, retired technocrats, and policymakers witnessed fresh evaluations by historians. Heeding Tony SmithÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s admonition to avoid Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201corthodoxy plus archives,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ this new generation of trained historians has been pouring new wine in new bottles.  This new historical scholarship does not take ideological bromides such as the Ã¢â\u201a¬ËœCold War did not happen in India because the country was nonaligned,Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢ or that Ã¢â\u201a¬Ëœnonproliferation was a US concern that did not affect IndiaÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢ at face value, thus bringing a much-needed corrective to our understanding of India and the role of Indians in the global twentieth century. When reading this new body of scholarship to which Ploughshares and Swords belongs, it is important for readers to be aware of this historiographical development and its intellectual effects.  Furthermore, over the last two decades, multi-archival and multilingual research has become the norm for those writing transnational and international histories, while political scientists adopting qualitative research methods have also joined in. The availability of primary sources in multiple countries has meant that it is sometimes possible to follow individual actors across multiple institutional spaces in different countries. As a result, researchers have to recognize their actorsÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢ diverse performativity: what these actors said and did at home (say, peace-loving, Gandhian, reticent Sarabhai) and what they did abroad (ponder on placing nuclear devices along the Himalayas to deter China at a key meeting with delegates from the American Academy of Arts and Sciences) were often strikingly differentÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u20ac� and the resultant meaning-making of all of this.  The other aspect is the exceptionalism of all things nuclear. All things fission-related are presumably so exceptional that they deserve, rightfully or not, their own histories: the so-called Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cnuclear histories.Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ This has led to the neglect of other important things that are connected to the nuclear story but treated as irrelevant. Moreover, there is overspecialization in our subfields of history and cognate disciplines. The Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cnuclear worldÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ not only has its own jargon and acronyms, but is also inhabited by experts who are physicists, chemists, engineers, technology reporters, and social scientists, who have contributed their lifeÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s work to the atom.  De-exceptionalizing the nuclear by foregrounding the social, political, and economic lives of the atom foments discontent amongst such experts, and perhaps even horror: Why talk about X when it is really about nukes? For me, challenging the exceptional nature of this history was an important intellectual goal. I did this through the territorial storyÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u20ac� the spatial expansion of the postcolonial nation-state and the reformulation of its bordersÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u20ac� concurrently with the techopolitics of Ã¢â\u201a¬Ëœfreedom of actionÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢ in the nuclear and space programs. It is an intellectual endeavor I am continuing to pursue with my next book that foregrounds land, labor, and debt in the so-called nuclear story.  For me, challenging the exceptional nature of this history was an important intellectual goal - Dr. Jayita Sarkar  MR: Even after all this time studying IndiaÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s nuclear program, were there moments or information that surprised you? Was there a source or finding that surprised you the most?  JS: Quite a few things surprised me while writing the book. Let us call them the three Cs: companies, contingencies, and continuities. First, the long lives and reaches of companies made it possible to write an interconnected story of capital, commodities, and expertise in ways I had not initially anticipated. I was surprised to find that immediately after the division of Germany, Homi Bhabha and S.S. Bhatnagar visited East Berlin in November 1948 to meet the technical personnel of Auergesellschaft, the company in charge of developing the Nazi nuclear bomb, to find out what know-how could still be procured about nuclear fission from them. Similarly, the significant role of the Tatas and their global financial networks in the Indian nuclear program allowed Bhabha quite a lot of leeway and made the nuclear program a business-government joint endeavor from the very beginning. There are a lot of companies Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u20acœ US, French, Canadian, and others Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u20acœ that emerged as key actors in my book. If one reads closely, a reader can find a blueprint in Ploughshares and Swords for rewriting the history of IndiaÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s nuclear program through the history of capitalism.  Second, contingencies are a key part of this story. It comes across most clearly during preparations of the nuclear test site in Pokhran, when one obstruction or another delays original plans. These matched closely with IndiaÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s slow annexation of the small mountainous kingdom of Sikkim, which surprised me. The connections between the two were very surprising to me, which I established using the Sikkim Palace Archives from the British Library. That said, I think we need further primary source research connecting the two. I have introduced the germ of an idea to the world with the hope that smart graduate students somewhere out in the world will make us smarter about this subject in a decade or less. I think it is important to encourage future scholars to think systematically about past events when records are fragmented, scant, and overclassified.  Third, I found more continuity than change than I had anticipated. Whether it was freedom of action/anti-dissent machine through opposition to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, playing multiple partners against each other to get the better deal, embracing legality, prioritizing reputation costs, and suppressing dissent, IndiaÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s nuclear program shows remarkable tendencies of continuity.

What books or projects are you working on that admirers of your work can look forward to?  JS: I am currently completing my second book, Atomic Capitalism. A Global History, which is under contract with Princeton University Press for their America in the World series. The book is a 100-year history of nuclear sites, from mining to energy to weapons testing, retold through histories of capitalism, empire, and decolonization. Research for this book has taken me to places I have never visited before such as the Four Corners of the United States and Namibia. It has been an exciting intellectual journey delving into new historiographical worlds for this book. I am on research leave next academic year to complete its writing. So, this would be the next thing readers would expect from me.  At the same time, I am continuing to think, research, and write for the next book project, Connected Partitions: A Global History of Territoriality, which is about the circulation of the idea and practice of territorial divisions from the South Asian subcontinent to the world. It is a fun project because it is very different from Atomic Capitalism, but just as fulfilling to me. The two are keeping me on my toes!

MR: Lastly, what did you think of Oppenheimer? Both as a moviegoer and historian of nuclear history.  JS: Ah, the eternal tension between being a scholar and a human. I watched the Oppenheimer in Edinburgh, Scotland where I live, on a weekday night in a near-empty theater. So, I was really able to focus! As a moviegoer for a movie that long, I was not bored at all. Time flew! The movie certainly has positive attributes in terms of getting young people interested in 20th century history and nuclear things in general. Several of my students at the University of Glasgow had discovered the Manhattan Project through the movie, deciding to take my Masters-level course, Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cNuclear Technologies in History, Politics, and SocietyÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ last fall.  Many years ago, I had read the book, American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer, by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin for which they received the Pulitzer Prize in 2006, and on which the movie is based. I knew Marty Sherwin through various historiansÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢ networks of the Wilson Center, and we were all shocked to lose him in 2021. I think the movie, which was exceedingly well done, certainly lived up to the expectations in terms of MartyÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s legacy as a historian and a writer.  Now, as a historian dabbling in nuclear things for nearly 15 years, of course I could not help but notice the erasures. There are several. Oppenheimer holding a booklet on uninhabited land before choosing Los Alamos as the site renders Indigenous dispossession completely invisible. Where are the French, one of the leaders in radioactivity and nuclear fission research before the fall of Paris, who contributed to the Manhattan Project from MontrÃƒÂ©al? Having spent some time in the Belgian State Archives in Brussels and seeing how significant uranium from Shinkolobwe (or Mine S as in the documents) from the Congo was for Los Alamos, I could not help but notice the silence on the transimperial connections. Finally, it is very easy to watch Oppenheimer and imagine it was an all-American story. The Manhattan Project was at least a trilateral endeavor with the US, UK, and Canadian governments directly involved. Moreover, without immigrant scientists fleeing Nazi persecution from continental Europe, it would not have materialized. Fortunately, my students know that because I make sure they do.

    "article_text": "BEIRUT -- The Lebanese militant group Hezbollah this week struck a military post in northern Israel using a drone that fired two missiles. The attack wounded three soldiers, one of them seriously, according to the Israeli military.  Hezbollah has regularly fired missiles across the border with Israel over the past seven months, but the one on Thursday appears to have been the first successful missile airstrike it has launched from within Israeli airspace.  The group has stepped up its attacks on Israel in recent weeks, particularly since the Israeli incursion into the southern city of Rafah in the Gaza Strip. It has struck deeper inside Israel and introduced new and more advanced weaponry.  \"This is a method of sending messages on the ground to the Israeli enemy, meaning that this is part of what we have, and if needed we can strike more,\" said Lebanese political analyst Faisal Abdul-Sater, who closely follows Hezbollah.  While the cross-border exchanges of fire have been ongoing since early October, \"complex attacks\" by Hezbollah began a few days after Iran's unprecedented drone and missile barrage attack on Israel in mid-April.  In the past two weeks, Hezbollah has escalated further in response to the Israeli incursion into Rafah, a Lebanese official familiar with the group's operations said. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to detail military information to the media.  The Thursday afternoon attack by a drone carrying missiles came just days after Hezbollah launched three anti-tank guided missiles at an Israeli military post that controlled a surveillance balloon flying over the border. They released camera footage afterward to show they had hit their mark. Hours later, the Israeli military confirmed that the spy balloon had been shot down over Lebanon.  The night before, Hezbollah had carried out its deepest attack in Israel to date using explosive drones to strike at a base in Ilaniya near the city of Tiberias about 22 miles from the Lebanon border. The Israeli military said the attack did not hurt anyone.  Abdul-Sater, the analyst, said the Iran-led coalition known as the axis of resistance, which includes the Palestinian militant group Hamas, has warned that if Israeli troops launch a full-scale invasion of Rafah in an attempt to go after Hamas, other fronts will also escalate.  Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi rebels claimed Wednesday that they attacked a U.S. destroyer while Iran-backed militants in Iraq have said they fired a series of drones toward Israel in recent weeks after having gone relatively quiet since February.  Hezbollah's use of more advanced weaponry, including drones capable of firing missiles, explosive drones and the small type of guided missile known as Almas, or Diamond, that was used to attack the base controlling the balloon, has raised alarms within the Israeli military.  \"Hezbollah has been escalating the situation in the north,\" said military spokesperson Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani. \"They've been firing more and more.\"  In adapting its attacks, Hezbollah has also managed to reduce the numbers of fighters lost compared with the early weeks of the conflict.  The group has lost more than 250 fighters so far, compared with 15 Israeli troops since fighting broke out along the Lebanon-Israel border a day after the Israel-Hamas war started on Oct. 7.  According to a count by The Associated Press, Hezbollah lost 47 fighters in October and 35 in November, compared with 20 in April and 12 so far this month.  The official familiar with the group's operations said Hezbollah had reduced the numbers of fighters along the border areas to bring down the numbers of casualties. While Hezbollah continues to fire Russian-made anti-tank Kornet missiles from areas close to the border, it has also shifted to firing drones and other types of rockets with heavy warheads -- including Almas as well as Falaq and Burkan rockets -- from areas several miles from the border.  Over the weekend, Hezbollah said it had launched a new rocket with a heavy warhead named Jihad Mughniyeh after a senior operative who was killed in an Israeli airstrike on southern Syria in 2015.  Eva J. Koulouriotis, a political analyst specializing in the Middle East and jihadi groups, wrote on the social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, that Hezbollah's recent escalation likely has several goals, including raising the ceiling of the group's demands in any future negotiations for a border deal, as well as raising military pressure on Israel's military in light of the preparations for the battle in Rafah.  Israel's Defense Minister Yoav Gallant vowed in a speech last week that \"we will stand, we will achieve our goals, we will hit Hamas, we will destroy Hezbollah, and we will bring security.\"  On Monday, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah reiterated in a speech that there will be no end to the fighting along the Lebanon-Israel border until Israel's military operations in the Gaza Strip come to an end.  \"The main goal of Lebanon's front is to contribute to the pressure on the enemy to end the war on Gaza,\" Nasrallah said.  His comments were a blow to attempts by foreign dignitaries, including U.S. and French officials, who have visited Beirut to try to put an end to the violence that has displaced tens of thousands of people on both sides of the border.  A day after Nasrallah spoke, Canada's Foreign Minister MÃƒÂ©lanie Joly visited Beirut and told Lebanon's private LBC TV station that she was pushing for a cease-fire.  \"We need the people living in the south of Lebanon to be able to go back to their homes,\" she said. \"We need to make sure that the Israelis living in the northern part of Israel are able to get back to their homes also.\"  Information for this article was contributed by Sam Mednick of The Associated Press.

    "article_text": "By Arshad Mohammed  WASHINGTON (Reuters) - White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan will visit Saudi Arabia this weekend for talks expected to touch on a civil nuclear cooperation agreement, one piece of a wider arrangement Washington hopes will lead to normalization of Israeli-Saudi relations.  Below is a description of the key issues involved in a U.S.-Saudi civil nuclear deal, what risks and benefits it may offer the United States and Saudi Arabia, and how it fits within U.S. efforts to broker Israeli-Saudi reconciliation.  WHAT IS A CIVIL NUCLEAR COOPERATION AGREEMENT?  Under Section 123 of the U.S. Atomic Energy Act of 1954, the United States may negotiate agreements to engage in significant civil nuclear cooperation with other nations.  It specifies nine nonproliferation criteria those states must meet to keep them from using the technology to develop nuclear arms or transfer sensitive materials to others.  The law stipulates congressional review of such pacts.  WHY DOES SAUDI ARABIA WANT A US NUCLEAR COOPERATION AGREEMENT?  As the world's largest oil exporter, Saudi Arabia at first glance is not an obvious candidate for a nuclear pact typically aimed at building power plants to generate electricity.  There are two reasons Riyadh may wish to do so.  The first is that under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's ambitious Vision 2030 reform plan, the kingdom aims to generate substantial renewable energy and reduce emissions. At least some of this is expected to come from nuclear energy.  Critics cite a second potential reason: that Riyadh might wish to develop nuclear expertise in case it someday wished to acquire nuclear weapons despite the safeguards enshrined in any deal with Washington to prevent this.  The Saudi crown prince has long said that if Iran developed a nuclear weapon, Saudi Arabia would follow suit, a stance that has fueled deep concern among arms control advocates and some U.S. lawmakers over a possible U.S.-Saudi civil nuclear deal.  The Sunni Muslim kingdom and Shi'ite revolutionary Iran have been at odds for decades.  HOW WOULD THE UNITED STATES BENEFIT FROM A CIVIL NUCLEAR DEAL WITH SAUDI ARABIA?  There could be strategic and commercial gains.  The Biden administration has made no secret of its hope to broker a long-shot, multi-part arrangement leading Saudi Arabia and Israel to normalize relations. It believes Saudi support for normalization may hinge partly on striking a civil nuclear deal.  The strategic benefits would be to shore up Israel's security, build a wider coalition against Iran and reinforce U.S. ties to one of the wealthiest Arab nations at a time when China is seeking to extend its influence in the Gulf.  The commercial benefit would be to put U.S. industry in a prime spot to win contracts to build Saudi nuclear power plants, as U.S. atomic companies compete with Russia, China and other countries for global business.  WHAT ARE THE HURDLES TO A US-SAUDI CIVIL NUCLEAR DEAL?  To start, it is all but inconceivable while the Gaza war rages.  Israel invaded the Gaza Strip after Hamas-led gunmen on Oct. 7 attacked southern Israeli communities, killing about 1,200 people and taking 253 hostages, according to Israeli figures.  The Gaza death toll, health officials in the Hamas-run coastal enclave say, has risen to more than 35,000 and malnutrition is widespread.  It is hard to imagine the Saudis being willing to normalize relations while Palestinians are dying in such numbers.  WHAT IS THE WIDER PACT IN WHICH A NUCLEAR DEAL MIGHT FIGURE?  The United States hopes to find a way to give Saudi Arabia several things it wants - a civil nuclear pact, security guarantees and a pathway toward a Palestinian state - in return for Riyadh agreeing to normalize relations with Israel.  Earlier this month, seven people familiar with the matter told Reuters the Biden administration and Saudi Arabia were finalizing an agreement for U.S. security guarantees and civilian nuclear assistance to Riyadh.  However, the wider Israel-Saudi normalization envisaged as part of a Middle East \"grand bargain\" remains elusive.  WHAT ARE SOME OF THE KEY ISSUES TO BE WORKED OUT IN A SAUDI-US NUCLEAR DEAL  A key issue is whether Washington might agree to build a uranium enrichment facility on Saudi territory, when it might do so, and whether Saudi personnel might have access to it or it would be run solely by U.S. staff in a \"black box\" arrangement.  Without safeguards built into an agreement, Saudi Arabia, which has uranium ore, could theoretically use an enrichment facility to produce highly enriched uranium, which, if purified enough, can yield fissile material for bombs.  Another issue is whether Riyadh would agree to make a Saudi investment in a U.S.-based and U.S.-owned uranium enrichment plant and to hire U.S. companies to build Saudi nuclear reactors.

    "article_text": "WASHINGTON Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u20ac� Lawmakers and advocates rallied outside the U.S. Capitol Thursday, urging House lawmakers to extend a fund for victims of U.S. nuclear testing that is set to expire in less than a month.  But critics say the program is too expensive and should be winding down, and itÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s not clear if the House will act before the looming deadline.  New Mexico Democrats Sen. Ben Ray LujÃƒÂ¡n and Rep. Teresa Leger Fernandez, and GuamÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s Republican House delegate, James Moylan, among others, called on House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana to bring the legislation to the floor.  Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cWe stand with community members from across the United States, ranging from New Mexico, where they exploded the very first atomic bomb, to Guam to Missouri to Navajo to Utah to Colorado to people in Texas,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ Fernandez said. Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cCommunities that share a common bond of hardship, of death and of illness that came about because of the nationÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s program to build and test atomic weapons.Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½  Legislation to expand and extend the fund already passed the Senate in early March in a bipartisan 69-30 vote.  Advocates and survivors have long said they were not warned prior to nuclear testing and were forgotten in the following decades as the consequences of nuclear fallout and waste affected their families.  The Radiation Exposure Compensation Fund, often shortened to RECA, was established in 1990 and pays one-time sums to those who developed certain diseases after working on U.S. nuclear tests before 1963, or who lived in counties downwind from test explosion sites between January 1951 and October 1958, and the month of July in 1962, in Arizona, Nevada and Utah.  Uranium industry workers who were employed in 11 states from 1942 to 1971 who subsequently developed qualifying diseases also qualify.  The U.S. conducted more than 1,000 atomic weapons tests from 1945 to 1992 Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u20ac� the first at the Trinity Test site near Alamogordo, New Mexico, where the U.S. tested the atomic bomb during the Manhattan Project prior to dropping the weapons on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan at the end of World War II.  As of June 2022, the Justice Department has approved more than 36,000 RECA claims for more than $2.3 billion in benefits.  Unless the Radiation Exposure Compensation Fund is extended, claims have to be postmarked by June 10, 2024, according to the Department of Justice.  Ã¢â\u201a¬ËœUnknowing, unwilling, uncompensated victimsÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢  A small crowd of activists wore Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cSave RECAÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ buttons and matching yellow t-shirts bearing the message Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cWe are the unknowing, unwilling, uncompensated victims of the Manhattan Project and Cold War.Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½  A sign on the small lectern read, Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cSpeaker Johnson Pass RECA Before We Die.Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½  Dawn Chapman, co-founder of the St. Louis, Missouri-based Just Moms STL, told the crowd that she and advocates have been in lawmakersÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢ offices pushing for RECA to be taken up on the House floor.  Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cSpeaker JohnsonÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s staff has met as of this morning with two community groups, ours being one of them. We did meet with his office for an hour-and-a-half,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ she said.  Under the Senate-passed bill, championed by Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley, the fund would extend the program by six years and expand eligibility in several new locations, as well as add qualifying diseases.  As written and if passed, the fund would reach areas including ZIP codes in Alaska, Kentucky, Missouri and Tennessee, where communities were impacted by radioactive waste dumping, uranium processing and other related activities surrounding the testing.  The bill would also expand downwind areas to include Colorado, Idaho, Montana, New Mexico, and Guam and increase the one-time compensation sums to victims or surviving family to $100,000, up from $50,000 to $75,000.  Hawley was not able to attend the press conference due to a last-minute conflict, according to his fellow lawmakers. But in a statement posted to X Thursday, he said, Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cThe good people poisoned by their governmentÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s nuclear radiation have been put off long enough Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u20acœ itÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s time to make this right.Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½  In a statement to States Newsroom, a Johnson spokesperson said Wednesday that Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cThe Speaker understands and appreciates Senator HawleyÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s position and is working closely with interested members and stakeholders to chart a path forward for the House.Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½  Concerns over cost  Critics say the expansion would just be too costly.  An earlier iteration of the expansion, which received 61 votes in the Senate, was attached to last yearÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s massive annual defense authorization bill, but eventually lawmakers stripped it from the package.  According to an analysis by the watchdog group Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, the cost of the expansion was slated to reach $150 billion.  Hawley cut the cost in his revised legislation that garnered bipartisan Senate support in March. The new price tag went down to an estimated cost of $50 to $60 billion over 10 years after Hawley removed some qualifying diseases, cut the scope of medical benefits and shortened the extension from 19 years to six years, according to the CRFB.  Still, critics worry that the funds will be designated automatic mandatory spending, meaning funding couldnÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢t be adjusted from year to year by lawmakers like discretionary spending.  Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cCompensation may very well be warranted for individuals harmed by the governmentÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s nuclear activities, but the substantial deficit impact of the legislation is concerning and unnecessary,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget wrote in March. The organization also pointed out that the cost is not offset by other federal spending cuts.  Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cThere is no reason why this well-known, long-term problem should not be addressed with careful consideration for both policy design and offsetting revenue increases or spending reductions,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ the organizationÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s statement continued.",

    "article_text": "This is the fourth U.S. Reaper drone being shot down by the Houthi rebels since October 2023.  YemenÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s Houthi rebels on Friday claimed to have shot down another American MQ-9 Reaper drone, circulating footage of the downed UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle), that served to identify the aircraft. They also released a video of the projectile in action used to bring down the Reaper.  This is the second shoot down of the Reaper by the Yemen-based group, in the previous two months, the last such hit taking place on April 26, 2024. Overall, this also makes it the fourth US drone being shot down since the war in Gaza began in October 2023, with the first brought down in November of that year, followed by another in February.  Previous episodes  The April 26 downing of the Reaper was confirmed by US Air ForceÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s Lt. Col. Bryon J. McGarry, a DoD (Department of Defense) spokesperson, who said an investigation was underway.  That shootdown saw the Houthis releasing electro-optical footage of the Reaper being captured in its AD (Air Defense) systemÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s cross hairs, and a missile leaving the launcher in dark conditions. It soon travels a distance and explodes in a fireball, suggesting it has hit its target.  The Houthi movement has published video of them shooting down an American MQ-9 Reaper drone with a surface-to-air missile, showing them using aerial reconnaissance drones of their own to track the American military hardware before taking it out of the sky. pic.twitter.com/rc3lKvlxFo Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u20ac� SÃƒÂ©amus Malekafzali (@Seamus_Malek) April 27, 2024  The interception seems to be happening at within-visual ranges. A subsequent thermal footage capturing the drone from the front also shows the missile hitting it from the side. The group then displays the crashed debris that includes the push-propeller section, the electronic and integrated circuitry and other components.

The region is held by the Houthis, which is opposed to the internationally recognized government.  The Houthis later released footage they claimed showed the surface-to-air-missile being launched at night, along with footage in thermal vision mode of the drone being captured in its EO/IR cameras. A man, whose voice had been digitally altered, possibly to prevent identification, chanted the Houthi slogan: Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cGod is the greatest; death to America; death to Israel; curse the Jews; victory to Islam.Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½  Several accounts on X later posted phone camera footage of Houthi fighters and locals surrounding the wreckage of the Reaper. Some analysts claimed that the Houthis used the Iranian Product 358 anti-drone UAV Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u20acœ or loitering SAM it as some observers have classified it Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u20acœ to bring down the Reaper. This aspect is however not yet clear.  Reapers, which cost around $30 million a unit, can fly at altitudes up to 50,000 feet and have an endurance of up to 24 hours before needing to land. The MQ-9 ReaperÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s defining features are its sophisticated multi-mode electro-optical sighting system, and communications technology.  It can coordinate with ground and air assets, watching surface movements from a safe altitude and distance. The Raytheon TechnologiesÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢ (now RTX) electro-optical Multispectral Targeting System-B (MTS-B) turret that provides real-time intelligence, targeting, and tracking.  Non-State Actor with a Professional Military?  The HouthisÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢ are significantly technologically superior compared to the last few adversaries the US fought, like Al Qaeda or the Taliban. Possessing an array of older, legacy air defense (AD) missiles, cheap yet effective Iranian drones that are usually shipped in disassembled forms, and some relatively advanced series of missiles and UAVs, the Houthis survived the combined military might of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in the eight-year-long civil war.  The group reportedly shot down Royal Saudi Air Force (RSAF), Yemeni, Emirati, Sudanese, Bahraini, Jordanian and Moroccan F-15s, AH-64 Apaches, Su-22s, MiG-29s, F-16s and several American MQ-9 Reaper drones. What missile the Houthis used to bring down the latest Reapers is not known. But Western analysts have drawn some studied inferences.  Besides Iran being the Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201ckey source for Houthi anti-ship missile technology,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ it has a Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cfew obsolescent Soviet-era systems and slightly less antiquated Chinese designs,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ according to a January 4 report by the International Institute of Strategic Studies (IISS).  The report names the S-75 Dvina surface-to-air missile, acquired from pre-war Yemeni army stocks, that it has converted for anti-ship roles using an Iranian conversion kit. Assuming the missile can still engage aerial targets even after the conversion, it can significantly threaten slow-moving, vulnerable drones.  Thus whether it is the S-75 Dvina or the Iranian Product 358, it is now likely that the US would possibly reevaluate tactics and SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures) of flying the Reapers over/near Yemen, as the airspace is certainly becoming contested for ISR drones.",

    "article_text": "A locator map shows Yemen and its capital, Sanaa. (AP)  DUBAI, United Arab Emirates Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u20ac� YemenÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s Houthi rebels hit an oil tanker in the Red Sea with a ballistic missile early Saturday, damaging the Panama-flagged, Greek-owned vessel in their latest assault over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip, officials said.  Though the Houthis did not immediately claim the assault, it comes as they claimed to have shot down another U.S. militaryÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s MQ-9 Reaper drone over Yemen and have launched other attacks on shipping, disrupting trade on a key maritime route leading to the Suez Canal and the Mediterranean Sea.  The attack around 1 a.m. struck the oil tanker Wind, which recently docked in Russia and was bound for China, the U.S. militaryÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s Central Command said. Both China and Russia maintain ties over military equipment and oil to Iran, the HouthisÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢ main benefactor.  The missile strike Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201ccaused flooding which resulted in the of loss propulsion and steering,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ Central Command said on the social platform X. Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cThe crew of M/T Wind was able to restore propulsion and steering, and no casualties were reported. M/T Wind resumed its course under its own power.Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½  The British militaryÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations center and the private security firm Ambrey similarly acknowledged the attack earlier Saturday. Ambrey said it caused a fire aboard the Wind.  It can take the Houthis hours Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u20ac� or even days Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u20ac� to claim their attacks.  The Houthis have launched attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, demanding Israel ends the war in Gaza, which has killed more than 35,000 Palestinians there. The war began after Hamas-led militants attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people and taking some 250 others hostage.  The Houthis have launched more than 50 attacks on shipping, seized one vessel and sunk another since November, according to the U.S. Maritime Administration.  Houthi attacks have dropped in recent weeks as the rebels have been targeted by a U.S.-led airstrike campaign in Yemen. Shipping through the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden still remains low because of the threat, however.  The Houthis claimed that they shot down the Reaper on Thursday with a surface-to-air missile. They described the drone as Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201ccarrying out hostile actionsÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ in YemenÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s Marib province, which remains held by allies of YemenÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s exiled, internationally recognized government.  Since the Houthis seized the countryÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s north and its capital, Sanaa, in 2014, the U.S. military has previously lost at least five drones to the rebels.  Reapers, which cost around $30 million apiece, can fly at altitudes up to 50,000 feet and have an endurance of up to 24 hours before needing to land.",

    "article_text": "Yemen's Houthi rebels launch a missile that strikes an oil tanker in the Red Sea, US military says  DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u20ac� YemenÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s Houthi rebels hit an oil tanker in the Red Sea with a ballistic missile early Saturday, damaging the Panama-flagged, Greek-owned vessel in their latest assault over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip, officials said.  Though the Houthis did not immediately claim the assault, it comes as they claimed to have shot down another U.S. military's MQ-9 Reaper drone over Yemen and have launched other attacks on shipping, disrupting trade on a key maritime route leading to the Suez Canal and the Mediterranean Sea.  The attack around 1 a.m. struck the oil tanker Wind, which recently docked in Russia and was bound for China, the U.S. military's Central Command said. Both China and Russia maintain ties over military equipment and oil to Iran, the Houthis' main benefactor.  The missile strike Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201ccaused flooding which resulted in the of loss propulsion and steering,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ Central Command said on the social platform X. Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cThe crew of M/T Wind was able to restore propulsion and steering, and no casualties were reported. M/T Wind resumed its course under its own power.Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½  The British military's United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations center and the private security firm Ambrey similarly acknowledged the attack earlier Saturday. Ambrey said it caused a fire aboard the Wind.  It can take the Houthis hours Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u20ac� or even days Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u20ac� to claim their attacks.  The Houthis have launched attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, demanding Israel ends the war in Gaza, which has killed more than 35,000 Palestinians there. The war began after Hamas-led militants attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people and taking some 250 others hostage.  The Houthis have launched more than 50 attacks on shipping, seized one vessel and sunk another since November, according to the U.S. Maritime Administration.  Houthi attacks have dropped in recent weeks as the rebels have been targeted by a U.S.-led airstrike campaign in Yemen. Shipping through the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden still remains low because of the threat, however.  The Houthis claimed that they shot down the Reaper on Thursday with a surface-to-air missile. They described the drone as Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201ccarrying out hostile actionsÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ in YemenÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s Marib province, which remains held by allies of YemenÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s exiled, internationally recognized government.

Earlier this week, the group struck a military post in northern Israel with two missiles fired from a drone, leaving three soldiers wounded.

    "article_text": "Experts are warning that President Joe BidenÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s latest plan for the Middle East could spark a nuclear arms race in the region among Islamic nations.  The details were contained in a New York Times report about the administrationÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s attempts to revive a deal that would normalize ties between Israel and Saudi Arabia, which collapsed after HamasÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢ October 7 terrorist attack.  The administration wants Israel to reward the Palestinian people for the unprecedented terrorist attack from Hamas, a terrorist group that they elected to run Gaza, by agreeing to give them their own official state.  Saudi Arabia has informed the Biden administration that it wants a U.S.-Saudi mutual defense pact, which would counter the threat it faces from the Islamic Republic of Iran, and it wants Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201ccooperation on a civilian nuclear program with uranium enrichment in the kingdom, the sale of advanced American-made weapons and, potentially, a trade deal.Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½  Israel is opposed to the deal because its government and people overwhelmingly oppose giving Palestinians their own state as experts warn that it will turn into a haven for Islamic terrorists.  Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud, also known as MBS, has indicated that a nuclear program for the country is his most important priority and that if Iran develops nuclear weapons then his country will, too.  Andrea Stricker, Deputy Director & Research Fellow at the Foundation for the Defense of DemocraciesÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢ Nonproliferation & Biodefense Program, said that the deal Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cguarantees a regional nuclear arms race.Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½  Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cThe Biden administration is playing with fire if they open a door to or assist the Saudis with uranium enrichment,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ she told The Daily Wire in a statement.

    "article_text": "By Song Sang-ho  WASHINGTON, May 18 (Yonhap) -- The United States on Saturday condemned North Korea's ballistic missile launches this week as a violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions, stressing its close coordination with allies and partners to address Pyongyang's \"dangerous\" provocations.  On Saturday, the North's state media reported that Pyongyang conducted a test-fire of a tactical ballistic missile equipped with a new \"autonomous\" navigation system Friday, in yet another sign of its push to sharpen its weapons capabilities.  \"The United States condemns the DPRK's May 17 ballistic missile launches,\" a State Department spokesperson said in response to a question from Yonhap News Agency. DPRK stands for the North's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.  \"Like all other DPRK ballistic missile launches in recent years, these launches violated multiple U.N. Security Council resolutions, and posed a threat to regional and international peace and security,\" the official added.  The spokesperson reaffirmed that Washington harbors no \"hostile\" intent toward the North.  \"We continue to consult closely with the Republic of Korea, Japan, and other allies and partners about how to best engage the DPRK, deter aggression, and coordinate international responses to the DPRK's ongoing and dangerous provocations,\" the official said.  The South Korean military said Friday that it detected the North's firing of several short-range ballistic missiles from the eastern coastal city of Wonsan. The missiles flew about 300 kilometers and landed in the East Sea, it said.  The latest launches came after South Korea and the U.S. staged combined aerial drills involving advanced stealth jets Thursday in an apparent show of airpower against evolving North Korean military threats.

On May 19, 2023, the first day of the three-day G-7 summit in the western Japan city of Hiroshima, the leaders of Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States plus the European Union adopted the Hiroshima Vision on Nuclear Disarmament, which reaffirmed their \"commitment to the ultimate goal of a world without nuclear weapons.\"  Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, who hosted the summit, continues calling for the realization of the vision. But momentum for nuclear disarmament has not increased, partly because Russia has threatened to use nuclear weapons in its military aggression against Ukraine.  The Hiroshima Vision was announced after the G-7 leaders, also including U.S. President Joe Biden, visited the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum on the first day of the summit. Hiroshima, which is Kishida's political home base, was devastated by a U.S. atomic bomb on Aug. 6, 1945, in the closing days of World War II. Kishida says realizing a world without nuclear weapons is his lifework.  The Hiroshima Vision also said, \"We reiterate our position that threats by Russia of nuclear weapon use, let alone any use of nuclear weapons by Russia, in the context of its aggression against Ukraine are inadmissible.\"  [Copyright The Jiji Press, Ltd.]",

    "article_text": "A China-bound oil tanker in the Red Sea was struck and temporarily disabled by a ballistic anti-ship missile fired by Houthi militants, the US Central Command said.  The strike Saturday on the Greek-owned M/T Wind caused flooding that knocked out its propulsion and steering, which the crew restored without help from a coalition vessel that responded to a distress call. The Wind, which most recently docked in Russia, resumed its course under its own power, Centcom said in a statement. No casualties were reported.  While Centcom didnÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢t provide a location, Agence-France Presse reported earlier Saturday that an oil tanker was hit near the Bab el-Mandeb strait, about 10 nautical miles (19 kilometers) southwest of the Yemeni port of Mokha. AFP cited maritime security firm Ambrey.  Iran-backed Houthis have been attacking warships and merchant vessels passing through the Red Sea since mid-November, especially those linked to Israel, the US and the UK, in response to IsraelÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s war against Hamas in Gaza. TheyÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢ve effectively closed a key global shipping route, forcing ships traveling between Asia and Europe to avoid the Suez Canal and go around southern Africa.  Separately, UK Maritime Trade Operations earlier reported a vessel with some damage, 98 nautical miles south of Al Hudaydah, Yemen. The ship known as the Master sustained slight damage after being struck by an unknown object on the port quarter. The ship and its crew were safe and continued to their next port of call.  Shipping and freight executives believe the Red Sea will remain too dangerous for many more months, if not the rest of the year putting some upwards pressure on energy markets.",

    "article_text": "Advertisement  Nevada: The United States conducted a subcritical nuclear test earlier this week at the Principal Underground Laboratory for Subcritical Experimentation (PULSE) facility in Nevada, according to a statement released by the US Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA). This test marks the third of its kind under President Joe Biden's administration.  The experiment, carried out on Tuesday, is part of the Nimble series and aims to collect \"essential data\" concerning the safety and effectiveness of the countryÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s nuclear warheads. Subcritical tests, which involve nuclear materials and possibly high explosives, are designed to avoid creating a critical mass of fissile material, thus ensuring no nuclear yield occurs. These tests are consistent with the United States' interpretation of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), which bans nuclear explosions but permits subcritical tests.  Advertisement  The NNSA emphasized that subcritical tests are crucial for maintaining the reliability and safety of the US nuclear arsenal without resorting to nuclear explosive testing. The US has upheld a moratorium on tests involving nuclear explosions since 1992. Despite this, subcritical tests have continued, with the previous one conducted in September 2021.  \"This experiment and all 33 previous US subcritical experiments were consistent with the zero-yield standard of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty,\" the NNSA stated. Marvin Adams, Deputy Administrator for Defence Programs, highlighted the importance of these tests, stating, \"We plan to increase the frequency of these subcritical experiments so we can continue to gather important data on nuclear weapons materials, with no technical need for a return to underground nuclear explosive testing.\"  Advertisement  Global Context: Rising Nuclear Tensions  The announcement of the subcritical test comes amidst increasing global nuclear tensions. Russian President Vladimir Putin recently ordered his military to practice the deployment of tactical nuclear weapons, citing threats from Western nations, including France, Britain, and the United States.  Advertisement  Russia's defense ministry confirmed that missile forces in the Southern Military District, along with aviation and naval units, will participate in these exercises. The Southern Military District, based in Rostov-on-Don, borders Ukraine and includes areas of Ukraine currently under Russian control. Belarus is also expected to be involved in these drills. The Russian Foreign Ministry linked these exercises to what it described as \"militant statements\" by Western officials, particularly highlighting remarks from French President Emmanuel Macron and British Foreign Secretary David Cameron. The delivery of US Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS) to Ukraine was also cited as a contributing factor.  Significance and Implications  The linkage of routine nuclear exercises to an ongoing conflict, as Russia has done, is highly unusual and has drawn significant attention from global powers. These exercises are expected to involve mock warheads being transported and prepared for deployment, demonstrating the readiness of various delivery systems such as the Iskander, Kinzhal, Kalibr, or Novator 9M729 missiles, as well as air-dropped bombs.  William Alberque of the International Institute for Strategic Studies noted the strategic importance of these exercises, particularly the interest in the Kalibr Kh-102 missile. \"The Kalibr Kh-102 is of great interest because the Kh-101 has been so comparatively easy for Ukraine to shoot down,\" Alberque said, suggesting that the war in Ukraine has heightened the significance of tactical nuclear weapons for Russia as a means of deterring and potentially countering NATO forces.",

    "article_text": "US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman met in Dhahran to discuss a range of issues, including normalization of ties with Israel.  This comes just days after two State Department officials met Iranian negotiators in Oman to discuss ways to prevent a further escalation of tensions and potential hostilities in the region.  A Saudi statement on Sunday also said, \"the semi-final version of the draft strategic agreements between the two countries, which are almost being finalised.Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½  The Biden administration is offering a strategic deal to the Saudis who have reasons to be wary of WashingtonÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s perceived soft stance toward Tehran in the past three years. In addition to security guarantees, part of the deal appears to be an agreement to assist a Saudi civilian nuclear program, as Iran has reached the weapons threshold under President Joe BidenÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s watch.  The de facto Saudi leader and President Joe Biden's top security aide also discussed the need to find a \"credible track for bringing about the two-state solution\" for Israel and the Palestinians, stop the war against Hamas militants in Gaza and facilitate the entry of humanitarian aid, the statement said.  Iran has repeatedly warned regional Arab countries against normalizing ties with Saudi Arabia. Last year, shortly before the Hamas attack on Israel, IranÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei said on October 3,\"The position of the Islamic Republic is that countries that make the gamble of normalization with Israel will lose. They are betting on a losing horse.Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ The comment came at a time when a final decision was made by TehranÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s Palestinian ally, Hamas, to launch the unprecedented attack that killed more than one thousand Israeli civilians. It is unlikely that Mr. Khamenei was not aware of the imminent attack.  IranÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s representative to the United Nations in New York confirmed the talks with US representatives, saying that Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cthis was not the first or the lastÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ round of talks. Observers believe that Biden has tried hard to prevent a region-wide escalation of the Israeli-Hamas conflict in an election year. Iran in the meantime has reiterated its support for Hamas and other armed militant groups in the region receiving financial and military support from Tehran.  US assistance to the Saudi nuclear program poses the question if Riyadh is willing to live with an Iran on the threshold of obtaining nuclear weapons, without pursuing a similar course to establish deterrence. In the past, Riyadh has not only reiterated its right to have full control over the nuclear cycle, but has threatened to develop atomic weapons if its security needs so dictate.  The Saudi crown prince has long said that if Iran developed a nuclear weapon, Saudi Arabia would follow suit, a stance that has fueled deep concern among arms control advocates and some U.S. lawmakers over a possible US-Saudi civil nuclear deal.  This leaves the possibility that a purely civilian Saudi nuclear program would be linked to US security guarantees, which in turn would mean some sort of dÃƒÂ©tente or deterrence with Iran. Recently, Iranian officials have been threatening Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201ca change in nuclear doctrineÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ if Israel threatens the countryÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s nuclear installations or the Islamic Republic regime itself. Currently, Tehran has accumulated sufficient fissile material for at least three nuclear warheads, and for the time being it seems interested to use the option as a leverage with Israel and the United States.",

    "article_text": "Iran may be just weeks away from developing nuclear weapons, according to Rafael Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Grossi visited Iran recently to strengthen the UNÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s oversight of the countryÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s nuclear activities. Despite some cooperation, including access to nuclear sites, IranÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s accelerated uranium enrichment has alarmed international experts. Giorgia Valente reports that Iran has reached 60% uranium purity, approaching the 90% required for weapons-grade material.  The situation has escalated since the US withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal, prompting Iran to roll back cooperation with the IAEA. Experts, including Steven Biegalski from Georgia Institute of Technology and Darya Dolzikova from the Royal United Services Institute, emphasize the urgency, noting that Iran is poised to achieve its nuclear goals swiftly.  Daryl Kimball of the Arms Control Association and Simon Henderson from the Washington Institute highlight the broader implications, including potential nuclear proliferation in the Middle East. The US, France, Germany, and the UK are urged to push for renewed Iranian cooperation with the IAEA. The full article by Giorgia Valente delves deeper into these pressing issues and the global response needed to address IranÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s nuclear ambitions.",

    "article_text": "Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty declares that NATO members will assist another member if attacked by Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201ctaking action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force.Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ But the UN Charter does not say anywhere that warmaking is authorized for whoever jumps in on the appropriate side.  The North Atlantic TreatyÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s authors may have been aware that they were on dubious legal ground because they went on twice to claim otherwise, first adding the words Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cAny such armed attack and all measures taken as a result thereof shall immediately be reported to the Security Council. Such measures shall be terminated when the Security Council has taken the measures necessary to restore and maintain international peace and security.Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ But shouldnÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢t the United Nations be the one to decide when it has taken necessary measures and when it has not?  The North Atlantic Treaty adds a second bit of sham obsequiousness with the words Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cThis Treaty does not affect, and shall not be interpreted as affecting in any way the rights and obligations under the Charter of the Parties which are members of the United Nations, or the primary responsibility of the Security Council for the maintenance of international peace and security.Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ So the treaty that created NATO seeks to obscure the fact that it is, indeed, authorizing warmaking outside of the United Nations Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u20ac� as has now played out in Yugoslavia, Afghanistan, and Libya.  While the UN Charter itself replaced the blanket ban on all warmaking that had existed in the Kellogg-Briand Pact with a porous ban plagued by loopholes imagined to apply far more than they actually do Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u20ac� in particular that of Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cdefensiveÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ war Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u20ac� it is NATO that creates, in violation of the UN Charter, the idea of numerous nations going to war together of their own initiative and by prior agreement to all join in any other memberÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s war. Because NATO has numerous members, as does also your typical street gang, there is a tendency to imagine NATO not as an illegal enterprise but rather as just the reverse, as a legitimizer and sanctioner of warmaking.  The Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty forbids transferring nuclear weapons to other nations. It contains no NATO exception. Yet NATO proliferates nuclear weapons, and this is widely imagined as law enforcement or crime prevention. The prime minister of Sweden said this week that NATO ought to be able to put nuclear weapons in Sweden as long as somebody has determined it to be Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cwar time.Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ The Nonproliferation Treaty says otherwise, and the people who plan the insanity of nuclear war say Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cWhat the heck for? WeÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢ve got them on long-range missiles and stealth airplanes and submarines?Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ The people of Sweden seem, at least in large part, to also want to say No Nukes Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u20ac� but when were people ever asked to play a role in Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cdefending democracyÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½? The purpose of bringing nukes into Sweden, for those in the Swedish government who favor it, may in fact be purely a show of subservience to U.S. empire, driven by fear of its obliging partner in the arms race, the militarists in Russia.  PolandÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s president says his country would be happy to have Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cNATOÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ nuclear weapons there, Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cwar timeÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ or not, and this proposal is reported in U.S. corporate media with no mention of any legal concerns and with the claim that it comes as a response to the Russian placement of nuclear weapons in Belarus. Last year I asked the Russian ambassador to the United States why putting nuclear weapons into Belarus wasnÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢t a blatant violation of the Nonproliferation Treaty, and he said, oh no, it was perfectly fine, because the United States does it all the time.  In fact, NATO itself owns and controls no nuclear weapons. Three NATO members own and control nuclear weapons. We cannot be certain how many weapons they have, since nuclear weapons are both justified with the dubious alchemy of Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cdeterrenceÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ and, contradictorily, cloaked in secrecy. The United States has an estimated 5,344 nuclear weapons, France an estimated 290, and Great Britain an estimated 240.  NATO calls itself a Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cnuclear allianceÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ and maintains a Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cNuclear Planning GroupÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ for all of its members Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u20ac� those with and those without nuclear weapons Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u20ac� to discuss the launching of the sort of war that puts all life on Earth at risk, and to coordinate rehearsals or Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cwar gamesÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ practicing for the use of nuclear weapons in Europe. NATO partners Israel and Pakistan are estimated to possess 170 nuclear weapons each.  Five NATO members have U.S. nuclear weapons stored and controlled by the U.S. military within their borders: Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and Turkey. These are estimated at 35 nuclear weapons at Aviano and Ghedi Air Bases in Italy, 20 at Incirlik in Turkey, and 15 each at Kleine Brogel in Belgium, Volkel Air Base in the Netherlands, and BÃƒÂ¼chel Air Base in Germany. The United States is reportedly also moving its own nuclear weapons into RAF Lakenheath in the UK, where it has stored them in the past. The people of each of these countries routinely protest the presence of nuclear weapons and have never been asked to vote on the matter. The notion that the nuclear weapons in a European country are still U.S. nuclear weapons and thus havenÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢t been proliferated is an odd fit with the general understanding of international treaties, which are conceived and written as if there were no such thing as empire.  With so-called U.S. or NATO nuclear weapons in potentially eight nations in Europe Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u20ac� and perhaps South Korea as well, at least on U.S. submarines docked there to please certain war-crazed South Koreans Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u20ac� there could soon be more nations in the world with Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cU.S.Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ nuclear weapons than nations with anybody elseÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s.  In recent years, the United States has been replacing its nuclear bombs stored in European nations with a newer model (the B61-12), while NATO members have been buying new U.S.-made airplanes with which to drop them. Turkey has had U.S. nukes stored in it even while U.S.-backed and Turkish-backed troops have fought each other in Syria, and even during a non-U.S.-backed coup attempt at the very base where the nuclear weapons are stored.  Seven other NATO members are said to support Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cnuclear missionsÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ using their non-nuclear militaries: The Czech Republic, Denmark, Greece, Hungary, Norway, Poland, and Romania.  Poland and Romania also host new U.S./NATO missile bases that could launch missiles into Russia from very short distances, leaving the Russian government mere moments to decide whether the weapons are nuclear, or to decide whether to launch missiles of its own. The U.S. and NATO claim the bases are purely defensive, and various supporters of the bases have even claimed they had nothing to do with RussiaÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u20ac�that they were either focused on Iran (then-U.S. President Barack Obama) or purely functioned as jobs programs for U.S. workers (former U.S. Ambassador Jack Matlock).  Meanwhile, the U.S. has been manufacturing what many of its officials describe as Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cmore usableÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ or Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201ctacticalÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ nuclear weapons (merely several times the destructive power of what was used on Hiroshima). At the same time, the U.S. military is aware that, in its war game scenarios, the use of a single so-called Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201ctacticalÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ nuclear weapon tends to lead to all-out nuclear war. Or, as then-Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis told the House Armed Services Committee in 2018, Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cI donÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢t think there is any such thing as a Ã¢â\u201a¬Ëœtactical nuclear weapon.Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢ Any nuclear weapon used any time is a strategic game-changer.Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½  The U.S.-made, disaster-prone F-35 is the first Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cstealthÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ airplane designed to carry nuclear bombs, meaning that it can in theory drop a nuclear bomb on a city with no warning from radar at all. The U.S./NATO have managed to sell F-35s to the U.S., UK, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Denmark, Belgium, Poland, Israel, Australia, Japan, South Korea, and Singapore, with efforts under way to spread them to more nations, eventually perhaps creating a general need for them on the grounds of Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cinteroperability.Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ The F-35 is currently being demonstrated on the people of Gaza.  The U.S. military has enough nuclear weapons in each of the following three forms to threaten all life on our planet: missiles on U.S. submarines in oceans around the world; bombs on U.S. airplanes circling the globe; and missiles in the ground in the United States. So why also keep nuclear bombs in European countries, where they would have to be loaded onto airplanes and flown (presumably to Russia) on missions either so Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cstealthÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ that they avoid all warning or so risky that they would have to be preceded by massive efforts to destroy air defenses?  If the decision to Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cgo nuclearÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ were up to NATO, all members would have to reach a consensus on it. However, NATO has not always easily reached a consensus. For example, the U.S. attempted to bring NATO into its plans for a war on Iraq in 2003 but failed, in part because of huge public pressure against that war in NATO nations. Nuclear war is one of the least popular ideas ever, so the launch of a nuclear weapon might have to be Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cstealthÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ not only in relation to Russia but also in relation to the Western public. If the U.S. decides to use nuclear weapons, it almost certainly will not bother trying to use the ones it keeps stored in Europe. For that matter, were U.S. officials intent on reaching secret bunkers under hills some distance from Washington, D.C., they would need significant warning that a nuclear war had been secretly scheduled Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u20ac� a problematic concept for both the idea of deterrence and the idea of democracy.  The purpose of NATO in the North Atlantic Treaty is supposed to be defense against an attack on Europe, not deterrence. But in the event of responding to such an attack, whether the response were nuclear or not, the U.S. bombs stored in Europe would probably not be used. Threats in the name of deterrence have tended to fuel arms races and wars. But keeping U.S. nuclear weapons in Europe seems to fail even by the usual standards of deterrence theory, since their most likely use would be in an unlikely secret attack. Some U.S. officials believe those nuclear bombs serve no Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cmilitary purposeÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ but only a Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cpoliticalÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ one, to reassure the host countries that the U.S. government cares about them.  The argument has also been made that, since Russia would like the nuclear bombs removed from Europe, the U.S. should either keep them there or demand something huge from Russia in exchange for removing them. Another argument is that this is part of making European nations share the burden, along the lines of making them spend more money on weapons. But if the burden serves no purpose, why should anyone share it? European government officials know the bombs are not useful as bombs. They know the bombs are provocative toward Russia. They know, in fact, that Russia is using the U.S. storage of nuclear bombs in European nations as an excuse to put Russian nuclear weapons into Belarus. So a more realistic understanding of the Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cpoliticalÃ¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ purpose of U.S. nukes in Europe is probably a combination of the idea that the U.S. military will fight for any nation in which it has stored nukes, the perverse prestige that many imagine comes with possessing nukes (even if someone else actually possesses them on your land), and the general U.S. goals of keeping European governments intertwined with the U.S. military, supportive of U.S. military strategies, and willing to spend vast amounts on U.S.-made weapons.  Spreading along with nuclear weapons is nuclear energy Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u20ac� climate-disastrous, slow, expensive, super-dangerous nuclear energy, which creates permanent deadly waste, which poisons those around it, which no insurance company will insure, and the facilities for which constitute nuclear catastrophes waiting for accident or attack. Listen to Harvey Wasserman on what drugs you need to take in order to believe that nuclear energy is good for the climate. Not only are various nations pursuing nuclear energy in order to be closer to developing nuclear weapons, but nuclear NATO countries like the U.S. and UK are promoting this spread of nuclear technology at home and abroad because it is through nuclear energy that they maintain skills, training, and materials they want for nuclear weaponry.  There is a better way, and everyone who cares about avoiding nuclear apocalypse is invited to join in preparations for unwelcoming NATO to its 75th birthday party this July in Washington DC: https://nonatoyespeace.org.

    "article_text": "A Ukrainian missile attack has destroyed a Russian minesweeper in occupied Crimea, UkraineÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s military has said.  The Ukrainian Navy did not give details on how the Kovrovets was destroyed, although the Russian ministry of defence said US Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS) missiles had been fired at Crimea.  Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cAnother bad day for the Russian Black Sea Fleet,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ the Ukrainian defence ministry said on X alongside a photo of the Kovrovets inside a targeting sight.  The US quietly gave Ukraine ATACMS missiles, a mobile surface-to-surface missile system with a range of up to 190 miles, in April after months of lobbying by Kyiv. Ukraine first fired ATACMS missiles at Russian forces three weeks ago and has since struck logistics bases, troop centres and airfields in occupied Donbas and Crimea.  RussiaÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s defence ministry denied that its minesweeper had been destroyed in the attack and said that its air-defence systems had shot down all of UkraineÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s missiles.  Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cBy air-defence duty systems, nine ATACMS operational-tactical missiles and one drone were destroyed over the territory of the Republic of Crimea,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ it said.  The alleged destruction of the minesweeper piles more pressure on RussiaÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s Black Sea Fleet, whose poor performance since the start of the war in Ukraine in 2022 has infuriated Vladimir Putin.  Black Sea failures  It failed to hold the strategically important Snake Island, its flagship has been sunk and several warships and submarines have been destroyed at harbour in occupied Crimea. Earlier this year, Putin sacked the commander of the Black Sea Fleet and ordered its officers to improve training for defending against missile and drone attacks.  Russian military bloggers said that Ukrainian attacks this week were the most intense for some time and may be linked to the arrival of ammunition resupplies from the US.  Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cThe enemyÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢s targets are military airfields, refineries and port infrastructure. The enemy inflicts, first of all, economic damage, which exceeds the costs of normal air-defence organisation,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ said the Two Majors Telegram channel.  Reports said that Ukrainian missiles had blown up a radar station and airfield in Crimea this week and drones had attacked the Novorossiysk harbour, where part of the Black Sea Fleet is based.  Video from Novorossiysk showed Russian marines firing air-defence cannons wildly at drones, celebrating when they hit one although they also appeared to spray harbour buildings.  Targets have also included oil refineries in Russia and the BBC quoted an unnamed source as saying that a Russian military airfield had been attacked in the Krasnodar region of Russia too.  Ã¢â\u201a¬Å\u201cAt this airfield, there were dozens of different aircraft that attacked Ukrainian positions,Ã¢â\u201a¬ï¿½ the BBC quoted the source as saying. It didnÃ¢â\u201a¬â\u201e¢t report on the success of the mission.",
